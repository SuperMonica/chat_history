In terms of grammar, the phrase \"every end of the year\" should be corrected to \"at the end of the year\" or \"every year-end\".Also, instead of saying \"I don't have much vacations\", it would be more natural to say \"I don't have much vacation time\" or \"I don't have many opportunities to take vacations\"."

Unfortunately, where I live, we don't get much snow in the winter, so we have to make the most of our limited vacation time. I wish we could go snowboarding more often, but for now, we'll just have to enjoy our yearly trips.\" \n\nThis version incorporates some informal language, such as \"hit the slopes\" (meaning to go snowboarding) and \"make the most of\" (meaning to take advantage of a limited opportunity). It also uses the phrase \"limited vacation time,\" which is a more natural way to express the idea that you aren't able to take many vacations."

Since my job requires me to sit at a computer all day, it's important for me to stay active and keep my body healthy. I've found that working out after work is a great way to destress and stay fit.\" \n\nThis version uses the phrase \"destress\" (meaning to reduce stress) and changes \"do workout\" to \"exercising\" for smoother word flow.

It also corrects some grammar errors, such as \"occur to my mind\" to \"came to me\" and \"ed a journy\" to \"embarked on the journey\". Lastly, it changes \"\u971e\u6155\u5c3c\" to \"Chamonix,\" which is the standard English spelling of the French ski resort."
