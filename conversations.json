This can be done automatically using various tools. Below is an example of a tool, Doxygen, which is popular for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports generating UML diagrams.\n\nHere are the steps to generate UML diagrams using Doxygen:\n\n1. **Install Doxygen**: \n\n   You can download Doxygen from their official website and install it on your system. \n\n2. **Install Graphviz (Optional)**:\n\n   Graphviz is open-source graph visualization software. Doxygen uses it to generate the graphs (like class diagrams, call graphs, etc.). It is optional, but if you want the generated documentation to have diagrams, you need to install Graphviz. \n\n3. **Configuration**: \n\n   Once Doxygen and Graphviz are installed, you need to configure Doxygen for your project.\n\n   - Navigate to your project directory.\n   - Run the command `doxygen -g`, which generates a default configuration file named `Doxyfile`.\n   - Edit `Doxyfile` with a text editor. The configuration file is well-commented and describes what each setting does. Here are some important configurations:\n     - Set `EXTRACT_ALL = YES` to extract all entities from source code, even if they are not documented.\n     - Set `RECURSIVE = YES` if you want Doxygen to traverse your directory tree.\n     - Set `GENERATE_LATEX = NO` if you don't want to generate LaTeX output.\n     - Set `HAVE_DOT = YES` if you have Graphviz installed. \n     - Set `UML_LOOK = YES` to enable UML-style diagrams.\n     - Set `CLASS_DIAGRAMS = YES` to enable generation of class diagrams.\n     - Specify your source and header files directory in `INPUT = ./your_code_directory`.\n     - Enable other diagram types (like call graphs and caller graphs) as per your requirements.\n\n4. **Generate UML Diagrams**:\n\n   Run the command `doxygen Doxyfile`. This will generate the HTML (and/or LaTeX if you've enabled it) output in the directories that were specified in the configuration file. The class diagrams will be included in the HTML pages of the classes.\n\nRemember that automatic UML generators only provide an approximation to the true design. Manual refinement may still be needed, especially for large complex systems."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa231e5-9813-48b2-a6d0-ecb7e6f3a546", "children": ["aaa2e688-34e2-4103-adce-b7f5b477a712"]}, "aaa2e688-34e2-4103-adce-b7f5b477a712": {"id": "aaa2e688-34e2-4103-adce-b7f5b477a712", "message": {"id": "aaa2e688-34e2-4103-adce-b7f5b477a712", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684756455.184369, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["where is the uml diagrams?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "3117f3d1-9dea-45b0-85e0-ca25723a9f79", "children": ["94422ddd-d784-41ec-874c-c5ecec0c3fc7"]}, "94422ddd-d784-41ec-874c-c5ecec0c3fc7": {"id": "94422ddd-d784-41ec-874c-c5ecec0c3fc7", "message": {"id": "94422ddd-d784-41ec-874c-c5ecec0c3fc7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684756485.914652, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["After running Doxygen on your project, you'll find the UML diagrams in the HTML documentation that Doxygen generates.\n\nThe exact location of these diagrams depends on the output directory that was specified in the Doxygen configuration file (the `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` setting in the `Doxyfile`).

You will need to pass the desired icon size as an integer. This will result in an icon with a size different than the text\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Using Anvil.js:**\n   You can use anvil.js to scale up the icon. Here's a Python function to do it:\n\n    ```python\n    import anvil.js\n\n    def scale_up_icon(component, scale=2):\n        dom_node = anvil.js.get_dom_node(component)\n        for icon in dom_node.querySelectorAll('i'):\n            icon.style.fontSize = f'{scale}em'\n\n    # Example use:\n    scale_up_icon(self.button_1, 3)\n    ```\n\n    In this example, `self.button_1` is the button that you want to change the icon size of, and `3` is the scale factor\u30106\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Using Roles:**\n   You can also use roles to adjust the icon size. This approach has the advantage of being visible in the design view. Here's how to do it:\n\n    In `theme.css`:\n    ```css\n    .anvil-role-icon-2x i.fa {\n        font-size: 2em;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In your Python code:\n    ```python\n    self.button_1.role = ['primary-color', 'icon-2x']\n    ```\n\n    In this example, `self.button_1` is the button that you want to change the icon size of, and `['primary-color', 'icon-2x']` are the roles you want to assign to the button.

The `<i>` tag is often used to display icons, especially when using icon libraries like Font Awesome.\n- `.fa`: This is a class selector in CSS. The dot (`.`) indicates a class. `fa` is a class used by Font Awesome, a popular icon library.

For larger images, it may be more efficient to store the images as separate files and load them in the usual way with the `url()` function.\n\nAlso note that this method sets the image as a background image, which may not be what you want if you need the image to be an `<img>` element in the HTML.

It seems there is currently an issue with obtaining more specific information about the EF EdTech division's recent projects.\n\nHowever, I can tell you about two recent projects of the EF EdTech division based on the information available:\n\n1. **EF English Proficiency Index (EF EPI):** This is the world's largest ranking of countries and regions by adult English skills. It provides a comprehensive ranking and detailed analysis of English proficiency in different countries and regions around the world.\n\n2. **EF SET:** EF SET stands for EF Standard English Test.

In this program, individuals travel abroad to live with a host family and take on responsibilities such as childcare and light housekeeping. In return, they receive a private room, meals, and a weekly stipend, as well as the opportunity to experience life in a different country and culture. \n\nHere are some key aspects of the EF Au Pair program:\n\n1. **Cultural Exchange:** This is the heart of the au pair program. As an au pair, you live with a host family in a foreign country and immerse yourself in their culture, language, and everyday life.\n\n2. **Childcare:** Au pairs are primarily responsible for looking after the children of the host family. This could involve anything from playing games and helping with homework, to preparing meals and driving the children to activities.\n\n3. **Learning Opportunity:** In addition to the cultural exchange, many au pairs also have the opportunity to study in the host country, often learning the language or taking courses on topics of interest.\n\n4. **Travel:** Living in a new country provides plenty of opportunities for travel and exploration, both within the host country and in surrounding areas.\n\nPlease note that the exact details of the program may vary depending on the host country's regulations and the specific arrangements made between the au pair and the host family.\n\nAs of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, that's the most accurate information I have.

This could include email, video conferencing tools, and perhaps a proprietary messaging system within a dedicated platform.\n\n3. **Web and Mobile Platforms:** EF likely provides web-based platforms and perhaps mobile applications where au pairs and host families can access information about the program, submit necessary documentation, and stay updated on their status.\n\n4. **Data Security Technologies:** Given the sensitive nature of the information involved in the au pair program (personal data of host families and au pairs), EF likely employs robust data security technologies to protect this information.\n\n5. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Software:** CRM tools can be used to manage interactions with current and potential customers (in this case, host families and au pairs), aiding in communication and service delivery.\n\nIt's important to note that these are reasonable assumptions based on industry standards and EF's overall approach to education and technology, but they may not be completely accurate.

However, given your expertise in AI, computer vision, and software development, I can still provide you with some general advice on the types of roles at EF that might be a good fit.\n\nBased on your skills and experience, you might be well-suited for roles such as:\n\n1. **AI Engineer**: As an AI Engineer at EF, you would be responsible for developing and deploying AI models, potentially focusing on areas like natural language processing, recommendation systems, or computer vision, depending on the specific needs of their various projects. Your proficiency in programming languages such as Python and C++, as well as your experience with OpenCV, would be highly valuable in this role. \n\n2. **Data Scientist**: As a Data Scientist, you would work with large amounts of data to derive insights and drive decision-making. This could involve creating models for predictive analytics, analyzing user behavior data, or developing machine learning models to personalize learning experiences. Your experience in data analysis and deep learning could be very relevant here.\n\n3. **Software Engineer**: As a Software Engineer, you could work on developing and maintaining the backend systems that support EF's various products and services. This could involve developing APIs, optimizing database structures, or working on the deployment and scaling of EF's services. Your full-stack capabilities and experience handling bugs efficiently would be essential in this role.\n\nIn terms of why EF could be a good fit for you, there are a few key reasons:\n\n1. **Innovation**: EF is known for its innovative approach to education, frequently incorporating cutting-edge technology into its services. This means you would have the opportunity to work on exciting, groundbreaking projects.\n\n2. **Data-rich environment**: EF's global reach and diverse array of services mean it has access to a wealth of data. This could provide you with the resources you need to develop and refine sophisticated AI models.\n\n3. **Impact**: EF's mission is to open the world through education. By working at EF, you would have the opportunity to contribute to this mission and make a meaningful impact on learners around the world.\n\nPlease note that this is general advice based on the information available to me as of my training cut-off in September 2021. I recommend visiting EF's career website or their LinkedIn page directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information on job openings."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "16cf7b60-c1cd-48f1-b37c-a69c411f4b08", "children": []}, "aaa2d5e0-6a48-42f4-80d0-107592baed17": {"id": "aaa2d5e0-6a48-42f4-80d0-107592baed17", "message": {"id": "aaa2d5e0-6a48-42f4-80d0-107592baed17", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684421123.058153, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\"\nAs a seasoned AI engineer with deep expertise in computer vision and software development, I bring a wealth of experience from diverse industries to the table.

I also have full-stack capabilities and am experienced in handling bugs with efficiency, as demonstrated by the web app I developed to streamline our workflow.\n\nHowever, my current job has not allowed me to fully leverage the latest AI techniques, leading me to seek new opportunities.

Your expertise in computer vision and software development would be highly valuable.\n\n2. **Machine Learning Engineer**: This role would involve developing machine learning models to personalize learning and improve educational outcomes. Your skills in Python and your experience with improving model performance would be relevant.\n\n3. **Data Scientist**: A role as a data scientist at EF would involve analyzing large amounts of raw information to find patterns, build models, and extract valuable insights. Your deep learning knowledge and data analysis skills could be put to good use here.\n\n4. **Full-Stack Developer**: Given your full-stack capabilities and experience in handling bugs efficiently, a role as a full-stack developer at EF could be a good fit. You'd be involved in developing and optimizing EF's web-based platforms.\n\nWhile I can't provide specific job listings at this moment, I encourage you to check the EF career page regularly for updated positions.

In many organizations, it's considered an entry-level or early-career position. Here's a general breakdown of job levels, starting from the bottom:\n\n1. **Entry Level**: These are typically the starting positions for new graduates or individuals with little experience in a field. Examples could include \"Junior Developer\" or \"Assistant.\"\n\n2. **Associate Level**: This is often the next step after entry level. Associates usually have a few years of experience and have gained more skills and knowledge in their field. They are often given more responsibilities than entry-level employees, but they are still generally under the supervision of a more senior employee.\n\n3. **Mid Level**: These positions are for people with significant professional experience. Titles might include \"Manager\" or \"Senior Associate.\"\n\n4. **Senior Level**: These positions are for professionals with substantial experience and expertise in their field. These employees often have leadership roles and significant decision-making responsibilities. Examples might include \"Senior Manager,\" \"Director,\" or \"Vice President.\"\n\n5. **Executive Level**: These positions are the highest level in the company and include roles like \"Chief Executive Officer (CEO),\" \"Chief Operating Officer (COO),\" or \"Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\"\n\nNote that the specific meanings of these levels can vary depending on the industry or company. For example, in some industries like consulting or finance, \"Associate\" can refer to a relatively senior position.

You can use image processing libraries like PIL (Pillow) or OpenCV to load the image data.\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Open image and convert to numpy array\nimg = Image.open(\"path/to/image.jpg\")\nimg_data = np.array(img)\n```\n\n2. **Serialize the data.** To pass the data to the subprocess, you need to convert the image data to a format that can be transmitted as input to the subprocess. A common method is to use pickle to serialize the data.\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\n# Serialize the numpy array\nserialized_img_data = pickle.dumps(img_data)\n```\n\n3. **Pass the serialized data to the subprocess.** You can use the `subprocess.run()` method to run the executable and pass the serialized image data as input.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Run the subprocess and pass the serialized data as input\nresult = subprocess.run(['path/to/executable'], input=serialized_img_data, capture_output=True)\n```\n\n4. **In your executable, deserialize the input.** The executable will receive the serialized image data as input. It needs to deserialize this data back into its original format to work with it.\n\nAssuming your executable is written in C++, you would need to use a library that can deserialize the data serialized by pickle in Python. One such library is `boost::python::pickle_suite`. However, working with serialized data between languages can be complex and may require careful handling of the data types and structures.\n\nPlease note that the details of deserialization will vary depending on the language the executable is written in. If your executable is also in Python, you can simply use `pickle.loads()` to deserialize the data.\n\n5. **Handle the image data in your executable.** Once the data has been deserialized, your executable can proceed to work with the image data.\n\nRemember that transmitting data between processes (inter-process communication, or IPC) can be complex, especially when working with binary data. Make sure to thoroughly test your code to ensure the data is being transmitted and received correctly. Also, be aware of the potential security risks associated with using pickle for serialization, especially when working with untrusted data.\n\nIt's also worth noting that for large image data, this method might not be the most efficient because it involves serializing and deserializing data.

Here's how:\n\n1. **Disk I/O**: Writing data to a file and then reading it back into another process involves disk I/O, which is generally slower than memory operations. If the image data is large, this could noticeably slow down your program.\n\n2. **Filesystem operations**: Creating, opening, and closing files are not instant operations. Again, if you are dealing with large data, these operations can add up and impact the performance.\n\n3. **Concurrency**: If your Python script and the subprocess need to operate on the image data simultaneously, writing to a file might not be the best option. You'd need to ensure that the subprocess doesn't attempt to read the file before the Python script has finished writing to it. This could require additional synchronization logic in your code.\n\n4. **Cleanup**: If you're generating a lot of temporary files and don't clean them up properly, they can take up significant disk space over time.\n\nOn the other hand, using files can be simpler and more robust in many cases. Files are a well-understood method of inter-process communication and work across different programming languages and environments. It's also easier to debug problems with files because you can inspect the file contents directly.\n\nAs always, the best approach depends on your specific use case. If the image data is not too large and the operation doesn't need to be performed very frequently, using files might be perfectly fine. If performance is a critical factor, you might need to look into more efficient methods of IPC, such as shared memory or pipes."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa20966-b466-4a48-bd58-2643d54a6830", "children": ["aaa275e1-af44-4c16-9bb6-558e8237785c"]}, "aaa275e1-af44-4c16-9bb6-558e8237785c": {"id": "aaa275e1-af44-4c16-9bb6-558e8237785c", "message": {"id": "aaa275e1-af44-4c16-9bb6-558e8237785c", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684396460.466557, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What's the most efficient way?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "23049c44-0ea2-414c-8f9e-6bb57eb9d12a", "children": ["c9495d2c-fb97-48bf-ad63-710ae92f1351"]}, "c9495d2c-fb97-48bf-ad63-710ae92f1351": {"id": "c9495d2c-fb97-48bf-ad63-710ae92f1351", "message": {"id": "c9495d2c-fb97-48bf-ad63-710ae92f1351", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684396530.335575, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The most efficient way to pass data between processes depends on the specific use case, including the size of the data, the frequency of communication, the programming languages involved, and other factors. However, here are a few options for efficient Inter-Process Communication (IPC):\n\n1. **Shared Memory**: This is one of the most efficient methods because it allows different processes to access the same block of memory. This avoids the need to copy data between processes. However, shared memory can be complex to use correctly because you need to handle synchronization (to prevent race conditions) and possibly also deal with different memory layouts if the processes are written in different programming languages.\n\n2. **Pipes**: Pipes are a traditional method of IPC that allow one process to write data to a \"pipe\" and another process to read from it. Pipes can be faster than writing to a file because they avoid the disk I/O, but they still involve copying data from one process to another.\n\n3. **Sockets**: Sockets are more commonly used for network communication, but they can also be used for IPC on the same machine. Sockets can be more flexible than pipes because they allow two-way communication and can handle multiple connections.\n\n4. **Message Queues**: Message queues allow processes to send messages to each other in a queue. This can be a good option if the processes communicate by sending discrete messages rather than large blocks of data.\n\n5. **Memory-mapped Files**: A memory-mapped file is a segment of virtual memory which has been assigned a direct byte-for-byte correlation with some portion of a file or file-like resource. This method avoids some of the overhead of reading or writing to a file traditionally and allows the operating system to handle caching, which can be more efficient.\n\nIn many cases, using a higher-level library or framework that abstracts away the details of IPC can make it easier to write correct and efficient code. Examples include the multiprocessing module in Python, or the Boost.Interprocess library in C++."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa275e1-af44-4c16-9bb6-558e8237785c", "children": ["aaa25224-5acb-4bd8-97b4-4bcf92e85f5f"]}, "aaa25224-5acb-4bd8-97b4-4bcf92e85f5f": {"id": "aaa25224-5acb-4bd8-97b4-4bcf92e85f5f", "message": {"id": "aaa25224-5acb-4bd8-97b4-4bcf92e85f5f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684396618.39025, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["show me the code example of using higher-level library to convert data from python to C++"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "c9495d2c-fb97-48bf-ad63-710ae92f1351", "children": ["370f70b1-524a-40f6-9c30-b416d9f0def6"]}, "370f70b1-524a-40f6-9c30-b416d9f0def6": {"id": "370f70b1-524a-40f6-9c30-b416d9f0def6", "message": {"id": "370f70b1-524a-40f6-9c30-b416d9f0def6", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684396761.463563, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Here is an example of how you could potentially pass image data from a Python program to a C++ executable using shared memory with the help of the `multiprocessing` module in Python and `Boost.Interprocess` in C++. \n\n**Python Code:**\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import shared_memory\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\nimport subprocess\n\n# Open image and convert to numpy array\nimg = Image.open(\"path/to/image.jpg\")\nimg_data = np.array(img)\n\n# Create shared memory object\nshm = shared_memory.SharedMemory(create=True, size=img_data.nbytes)\n\n# Now create a NumPy array backed by shared memory\nnp_array = np.ndarray(img_data.shape, dtype=img_data.dtype, buffer=shm.buf)\n\n# Copy the data to our shared memory backed array\nnp.copyto(np_array, img_data)\n\n# Run the subprocess and pass the name of the shared memory block\nsubprocess.run(['path/to/executable', shm.name])\n```\n\n**C++ Code:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <boost/interprocess/shared_memory_object.hpp>\n#include <boost/interprocess/mapped_region.hpp>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    using namespace boost::interprocess;\n\n    // Get the name of the shared memory block\n    const char* shm_name = argv[1];\n\n    // Open the shared memory block\n    shared_memory_object shm(open_only, shm_name, read_only);\n\n    // Map the whole shared memory in this process\n    mapped_region region(shm, read_only);\n\n    // Get the address of the mapped region\n    void* addr = region.get_address();\n\n    // Construct a NumPy array at the mapped region address\n    // Note: You need to know the shape and data type of the array\n    // This can be passed as additional arguments or stored in the shared memory\n    int shape[] = { /* shape of the array */ };\n    np::ndarray img_data = np::from_data(addr, np::dtype::get_builtin<np::uint8>(), shape);\n\n    // Now you can use img_data as a normal NumPy array\n    // ...\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis is a very high-level example and there are many details you would need to take care of in a real-world scenario:\n\n* **Data type and shape**: The C++ code needs to know the data type and shape of the array. In this example, we assume that it's an array of uint8 (common for images), but in a real-world scenario, you would need a way to pass this information from Python to C++.\n\n* **Memory management**: The shared memory block needs to be deleted after it's no longer needed, otherwise, it will stay in memory until the system is rebooted. You can delete it in the Python program with `shm.close()` and `shm.unlink()`, but you need to ensure that the C++ program has finished using it by the time you delete it.\n\n* **Error handling**: The code doesn't handle any errors that might occur, such as failing to open the image file in Python, or failing to open the shared memory block in C++.\n\n* **Synchronization**: If the Python and C++ programs are running concurrently (which is often the case when using IPC), you need to ensure that the C++ program doesn't start reading from the shared memory before the Python program has finished writing to it. This can be achieved with various synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores or condition variables.\n\nPlease note that working with shared memory and inter-language communication can be complex and requires a good understanding of both Python and C++ memory management.

This means that you can't directly use methods like shared memory or writing to a file to pass data between processes in different containers.\n\nOne option for inter-container communication is to use network communication, treating the two containers as if they were on different machines. Here's how you could do it:\n\n1. **Set up a network connection between the containers.** In Docker, you can do this by creating a user-defined network and attaching both containers to it.\n\n2. **In the Python program, set up a server that sends the image data over a socket.** You can use the `socket` module in Python to do this.\n\n3. **In the C++ program, set up a client that receives the image data over a socket.** You can use the `boost::asio` library in C++ to do this.\n\nHere's a simplified example:\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Open image and convert to numpy array\nimg = Image.open(\"path/to/image.jpg\")\nimg_data = np.array(img)\n\n# Set up a server socket\nwith socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:\n    s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 12345))  # Replace with your desired port\n    s.listen()\n    conn, addr = s.accept()\n\n    with conn:\n        print('Connected by', addr)\n        conn.sendall(img_data.tobytes())\n```\n\n**C++ Code:**\n\n```cpp\n#include <boost/asio.hpp>\n\nint main() {\n    boost::asio::io_context io_context;\n    boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket socket(io_context);\n\n    // Replace with your server's IP and port\n    boost::asio::ip::tcp::endpoint endpoint(boost::asio::ip::address::from_string(\"127.0.0.1\"), 12345);\n    socket.connect(endpoint);\n\n    // Replace with the size of the image data\n    std::vector<uint8_t> img_data( /* size of the image data */ );\n    boost::asio::read(socket, boost::asio::buffer(img_data));\n\n    // Now you can use img_data as a normal std::vector\n    // ...\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nAgain, this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle various issues:\n\n* **Data type, shape, and size**: The C++ code needs to know the data type, shape, and size of the array. You could send this information before the image data itself, or use a more complex protocol that includes metadata.\n\n* **Error handling**: The code doesn't handle any errors that might occur, such as network errors or failing to open the image file in Python.\n\n* **Concurrency**: If the Python and C++ programs are running concurrently, you need to ensure that the C++ program doesn't start reading from the socket before the Python program has finished writing to it.\n\n* **Security**: If the containers are not on a secure private network, you might need to secure the connection between them, for example by using SSL/TLS.\n\nIf the containers are on the same machine and you have control over how they're run, another option could be to use Docker volumes to share a file or a directory between the containers. This would allow you to use the file-based method described earlier. However, this approach has its own complexities and potential issues, such as ensuring that the file is not read before it's fully written."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2b4e7-d365-4454-901b-d0b0acce6a3e", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "2e3434e9-a9ce-4e23-a331-22d6509ab5ec", "plugin_ids": null, "id": "81ea4539-fb23-40a2-8a86-e20665197296"}, {"title": "Midjourney Image Generation.", "create_time": 1684383162.906737, "update_time": 1684394946.0, "mapping": {"3aa57701-c2bb-4710-9084-d005c03ceb8f": {"id": "3aa57701-c2bb-4710-9084-d005c03ceb8f", "message": {"id": "f716c886-d09e-443a-b3d9-2272124d70df", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684384715.523886, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa112c8-f15b-4eae-9a8e-438787681a20", "children": ["aaa24014-18e7-4eb6-ac31-aa864ab10d83", "aaa2075a-bdf4-450a-950d-60e5d3d1a2d7"]}, "aaa112c8-f15b-4eae-9a8e-438787681a20": {"id": "aaa112c8-f15b-4eae-9a8e-438787681a20", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["3aa57701-c2bb-4710-9084-d005c03ceb8f"]}, "aaa24014-18e7-4eb6-ac31-aa864ab10d83": {"id": "aaa24014-18e7-4eb6-ac31-aa864ab10d83", "message": {"id": "aaa24014-18e7-4eb6-ac31-aa864ab10d83", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383162.907771, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Show me some good examples of midjourney prompts"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "3aa57701-c2bb-4710-9084-d005c03ceb8f", "children": ["790410ef-b51a-4319-9e6c-4f076a21ffec"]}, "790410ef-b51a-4319-9e6c-4f076a21ffec": {"id": "790410ef-b51a-4319-9e6c-4f076a21ffec", "message": {"id": "790410ef-b51a-4319-9e6c-4f076a21ffec", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383169.204847, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Midjourney prompts are typically used in marketing or UX design to guide users through a process or journey, encouraging engagement and progression.

Version 2 of their algorithm was launched in April 2022[9] and version 3 on July 25.[10] On November 5, 2022, the alpha iteration of version 4 was released to users[11][12] and on March 15, 2023, the alpha iteration of version 5 was released.[13] The 5.1 model is more 'opinionated' than version 5, applying more of its own stylization to images, while the 5.1 RAW model adds improvement while working better with more literal prompts. \n\nRegular models   \nVersion Release date   \nV1 February 2022[14]  \nV2 April 12, 2022[9]  \nV3 July 25, 2022[10]  \nV4 November 5, 2022 (alpha)[11]  \nV5 March 15, 2023 (alpha)[13]  \nV5.1 May 3, 2023[15]  \n\n     Other models   \nVersion Release date Notes   \n--beta August 22, 2022  \ntest/testp August 28, 2022  \nNiji December 20, 2022 Collaboration between Midjourney and Spellbrush   \ntuned to produce anime and illustrative styles   \nNiji 5 April 2, 2023   \n\n## Functionality[edit]\n\nMidjourney is currently only accessible through a Discord bot on their official Discord server, by direct messaging the bot, or by inviting the bot to a third party server. To generate images, users use the `/imagine` command and type in a prompt; the bot then returns a set of four images. Users may then choose which images they want to upscale. Midjourney is also working on a web interface.[16]\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\nFounder David Holz says he sees artists as customers, not competitors of Midjourney. Holz told The Register that artists use Midjourney for rapid prototyping of artistic concepts to show to clients before starting work themselves.[5] Some artists have accused Midjourney of devaluing original creative work by using it in the training set;[17] Midjourney's terms of service includes a DMCA takedown policy, allowing artists to request their work to be removed from the set if they believe copyright infringement to be evident.[18]\n\nThe advertising industry has been quick to embrace AI tools such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, among others. The tools, which enable advertisers to create original content and brainstorm ideas quickly are providing new opportunities such as \"custom ads created for individuals, a new way to create special effects, or even making e-commerce advertising more efficient\", according to Ad Age.[19]\n\n### Notable usage and controversy[edit]\n\nExternal image  \n[Image: image icon] Fake images involving personalities and created\nVisible: 8% - 35%", "pub_date": "2023-05-17"}], "original_query": null}, "command": "quote", "args": ["Midjourney is currently only accessible through", "bot then returns a set of four images.

Some require a PC equipped with a high-end, expensive graphics card, but Midjourney stands out from the crowd as it needs no specialized hardware at all.\n\nMidjourney runs entirely from a Discord server, opening up the AI art world to millions of people. If you want to join them, continue reading our quick guide on using this fantastic tool.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe first thing you will need is a Discord account \u2013 you can download and use the \u301060\u2020dedicated app\u3011 or simply do it via your \u301061\u2020web browser\u2020discord.com\u3011. That means you can use Midjourney on most devices running Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, or Android.\n\nOnce you are on Discord, join the \u301062\u2020Midjourney server\u2020discord.gg\u3011.\n\nEssentially, what you're going to do is \"chat\" with the Midjourney bot. All messages, for generating images, start with /imagine prompt. The example you can see below was created by sending: /imagine prompt astronaut on a horse to the bot.\n\n[Image]\n\nOnce you're in, you'll see a long list of channels, but for now head for one of the Newcomer Rooms. Here you will see other members making prompts and the resulting images. It will give you a first glimpse of the platform and let you become familiar with the tool.\n\nThere used to be a free trial for new users to experiment with Midjourney, but due to the immense demand it placed on the servers, this has been removed. As a result, you'll need a subscription plan to access everything. Occasionally, a free trial is offered, most notably when a new AI model is released, but it's relatively infrequent. We'll revisit the topic of subscriptions later, and for the remainder of this guide, we'll assume you have the most basic plan.\n\nMidjourney always generates 4 images from the prompts and gives you three options:\n\n  * Redo the whole process to get a new set (the blue double-arrow button)\n  * Upscale one of the four pictures (the U1, U2, U3, U4 buttons)\n  * Use one of the four as a starting template for another run (the V1, V2, V3, V4 buttons).\n\nIt takes a couple of minutes to compose images; however, depending on the server's workload, there might be a longer pause before you can receive your results. With so many people in the channels, your results will quickly scroll out of view, so be sure to keep an eye out for them.\n\n## Using commands and prompt parameters\n\nThe AI image generator supports a number of commands and parameters to adjust what and how it manages the process, most of which you add after the descriptive text. You don't need to use these, as by default, Midjourney will use the latest public model (version 5.1) and create 512 x 512 pictures (older models are 256 x 256).\n\nThe differences between the various models lie mainly in two aspects \u2013 how effectively they interpret the prompt and how accurately the generated image corresponds to the input text (a property known as coherency).\n\n[Image]\n\n\"Vibrant California poppies\" v4 (left) versus v5 (right).\n\nThe more recent Midjourney versions (4, 5, and 5.1) all have very high coherency, though version 4's strength is with image-based prompts; version 5 and 5.1 are extremely good at handling natural text prompts.\n\nVersion 3 has moderate coherency, and the others are all rated as low. That might sound like a bad thing, but if you're after a creative/abstract interpretation of your prompt, then the older models are perfect for this.\n\n#### Model parameters\n\n  * --version or --v will change which \u301063\u2020deep learning model\u2020docs.midjourney.com\u3011 gets used. Leave a space after the last letter and then add 1, 2, 3, etc.\n  * --style can be used to tweak model version 4 (e.g. --style 4b) if you're looking for further variations on the same theme\n  * --niji is another model, but one that's been trained on lots of anime illustrations and art\n\n[Image]\n\nDefault model (left) vs Niji (right)\n\n#### Image parameters\n\n  * --aspect or --ar will change the ratio of width to height of the images. The default is 1:1 but 3:2, 16:9, 16:10, and others are supported.\n  * --chaos [0 to 100] will alter how 'creative' the images will be, with higher values giving you increasingly more oddball results\n  * --stylize or --s [0 to 1000] adjusts how closely the generator sticks to the prompt. The default value is 100 in model v4, and higher values produce images that are less bound to the descriptor.\n  * --quality or --q [0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2] controls how much GPU processing time is allocated to making the image. The default value 1, so if you want to save some precious Midjourney usage time, while experimenting with prompts, using a lower value is really key. The value of 2 only applies to model version 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThere are more commands and parameters to explore, you can head over to the \u301064\u2020Midjourney website\u2020docs.midjourney.com\u3011 for further details.\n\n## Using images instead of prompts\n\nMidjourney can also use images, instead of text, to create new pieces of art. Instead of typing /imagine, use /blend and then upload up to 5 pictures from your storage drive into Discord.\n\nThe blend function works best\nVisible: 0% - 42%", "summary": "www.techspot.com (www.techspot.com)\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"title": "www.techspot.com", "url": "https://www.techspot.com/guides/2648-midjourney-ai/", "text": "\nURL: https://www.techspot.com/guides/2648-midjourney-ai/\nPublication Date: 2023-05-10\n  \n\n  * User login User icon Login \n  *   \n\n  *  Search A search icon    \n\n   TechSpot logo The word TechSpot  \n\n  * Trending \n\n    * Ryzen 7600 vs Ryzen 5600\n    * Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Stable Diffusion How-To\n    * Radeon 7900 XT vs RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Steam Deck Gaming\n\n  * Features \n\n    * Tech Culture\n    * Must Reads\n    * Hardware\n    * Software\n    * Gaming\n    * Explainers\n    * Tips & Tricks\n\n  * Reviews \n\n    * CPU\n    * Graphics Cards\n    * Laptops\n    * Storage\n    * Monitors\n    * More Reviews\n\n  * The Best \n\n    * Best CPUs\n    * Best Graphics Cards\n    * Best Monitors\n    * Best Software\n    * Best SSD\n    * Best PC Speakers\n\n  * Downloads \n\n    * Latest Updates\n    * Popular Apps\n    * Software We Recommend\n    * Drivers\n\n  * Product Finder \n\nSearch\n\n  * Forums \n\n    * Join TechSpot Elite\n    * New Posts\n    * Latest Comments\n\n  * Jobs \n\n  * Software \n  * Tech Culture \n\n# How to Use Midjourney to Create AI Images\n\n## Generate High Grade AI Images Leveraging the Cloud\n\nBy  Nick Evanson  May 10, 2023 \n\n  [Image] \n\nTechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary.

You don't need to use these, as by default, Midjourney will use the latest public model (version 5.1) and create 512 x 512 pictures (older models are 256 x 256).\n\nThe differences between the various models lie mainly in two aspects \u2013 how effectively they interpret the prompt and how accurately the generated image corresponds to the input text (a property known as coherency).\n\n[Image]\n\n\"Vibrant California poppies\" v4 (left) versus v5 (right).\n\nThe more recent Midjourney versions (4, 5, and 5.1) all have very high coherency, though version 4's strength is with image-based prompts; version 5 and 5.1 are extremely good at handling natural text prompts.\n\nVersion 3 has moderate coherency, and the others are all rated as low. That might sound like a bad thing, but if you're after a creative/abstract interpretation of your prompt, then the older models are perfect for this.\n\n#### Model parameters\n\n  * --version or --v will change which deep learning model gets used. Leave a space after the last letter and then add 1, 2, 3, etc.\n  * --style can be used to tweak model version 4 (e.g. --style 4b) if you're looking for further variations on the same theme\n  * --niji is another model, but one that's been trained on lots of anime illustrations and art\n\n[Image]\n\nDefault model (left) vs Niji (right)\n\n#### Image parameters\n\n  * --aspect or --ar will change the ratio of width to height of the images. The default is 1:1 but 3:2, 16:9, 16:10, and others are supported.\n  * --chaos [0 to 100] will alter how 'creative' the images will be, with higher values giving you increasingly more oddball results\n  * --stylize or --s [0 to 1000] adjusts how closely the generator sticks to the prompt. The default value is 100 in model v4, and higher values produce images that are less bound to the descriptor.\n  * --quality or --q [0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2] controls how much GPU processing time is allocated to making the image. The default value 1, so if you want to save some precious Midjourney usage time, while experimenting with prompts, using a lower value is really key. The value of 2 only applies to model version 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThere are more commands and parameters to explore, you can head over to the Midjourney website for further details.\n\n## Using images instead of prompts\n\nMidjourney can also use images, instead of text, to create new pieces of art. Instead of typing /imagine, use /blend and then upload up to 5 pictures from your storage drive into Discord.\n\nThe blend function works best\nVisible: 0% - 42%", "pub_date": "2023-05-10"}], "original_query": null}, "command": "click", "args": [4], "status": "finished", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "12b24eec-e3b9-44c3-9ded-29c63d0d7ad6", "children": ["26752a01-add4-4144-9ee7-f9ee61d73704"]}, "26752a01-add4-4144-9ee7-f9ee61d73704": {"id": "26752a01-add4-4144-9ee7-f9ee61d73704", "message": {"id": "26752a01-add4-4144-9ee7-f9ee61d73704", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383566.210469, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "# This quote explains what Midjourney is and provides some examples of how it works.\nquote(\"AI-based image generators are hugely\", \"keep an eye out for them.\")\nquote(\"Using commands and prompt parameters\", \"older models are perfect for this.\")\nquote(\"Model parameters\", \"anime illustrations and art\")\nquote(\"Image parameters\", \"version 1, 2, and 3.\")\nquote(\"Using images instead of prompts\", \"upload up to 5 pictures from your storage drive into Discord.\")"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "a9abdd56-72d4-4a1b-aa8c-ef00de2bb981", "children": ["985414e3-dbca-4f29-8da8-795456359f67"]}, "985414e3-dbca-4f29-8da8-795456359f67": {"id": "985414e3-dbca-4f29-8da8-795456359f67", "message": {"id": "985414e3-dbca-4f29-8da8-795456359f67", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383566.211014, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "https://www.techspot.com/guides/2648-midjourney-ai/", "domain": "www.techspot.com", "text": "AI-based image generators are hugely popular at the moment, with many options to choose from to scratch that creative itch.

Some require a PC equipped with a high-end, expensive graphics card, but Midjourney stands out from the crowd as it needs no specialized hardware at all.\n\nMidjourney runs entirely from a Discord server, opening up the AI art world to millions of people. If you want to join them, continue reading our quick guide on using this fantastic tool.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe first thing you will need is a Discord account \u2013 you can download and use the dedicated app or simply do it via your web browser. That means you can use Midjourney on most devices running Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, or Android.\n\nOnce you are on Discord, join the Midjourney server.\n\nEssentially, what you're going to do is \"chat\" with the Midjourney bot. All messages, for generating images, start with /imagine prompt. The example you can see below was created by sending: /imagine prompt astronaut on a horse to the bot.\n\n[Image]\n\nOnce you're in, you'll see a long list of channels, but for now head for one of the Newcomer Rooms. Here you will see other members making prompts and the resulting images. It will give you a first glimpse of the platform and let you become familiar with the tool.\n\nThere used to be a free trial for new users to experiment with Midjourney, but due to the immense demand it placed on the servers, this has been removed. As a result, you'll need a subscription plan to access everything. Occasionally, a free trial is offered, most notably when a new AI model is released, but it's relatively infrequent. We'll revisit the topic of subscriptions later, and for the remainder of this guide, we'll assume you have the most basic plan.\n\nMidjourney always generates 4 images from the prompts and gives you three options:\n\n  * Redo the whole process to get a new set (the blue double-arrow button)\n  * Upscale one of the four pictures (the U1, U2, U3, U4 buttons)\n  * Use one of the four as a starting template for another run (the V1, V2, V3, V4 buttons).\n\nIt takes a couple of minutes to compose images; however, depending on the server's workload, there might be a longer pause before you can receive your results. With so many people in the channels, your results will quickly scroll out of view, so be sure to keep an eye out for them.\n\n## Using commands and prompt parameters\n\nThe AI image generator supports a number of commands and parameters to adjust what and how it manages the process, most of which you add after the descriptive text. You don't need to use these, as by default, Midjourney will use the latest public model (version 5.1) and create 512 x 512 pictures (older models are 256 x 256).\n\nThe differences between the various models lie mainly in two aspects \u2013 how effectively they interpret the prompt and how accurately the generated image corresponds to the input text (a property known as coherency).\n\n[Image]\n\n\"Vibrant California poppies\" v4 (left) versus v5 (right).\n\nThe more recent Midjourney versions (4, 5, and 5.1) all have very high coherency, though version 4's strength is with image-based prompts; version 5 and 5.1 are extremely good at handling natural text prompts.\n\nVersion 3 has moderate coherency, and the others are all rated as low. That might sound like a bad thing, but if you're after a creative/abstract interpretation of your prompt, then the older models are perfect for this.\n\n#### Model parameters\n\n  * --version or --v will change which deep learning model gets used. Leave a space after the last letter and then add 1, 2, 3, etc.\n  * --style can be used to tweak model version 4 (e.g. --style 4b) if you're looking for further variations on the same theme\n  * --niji is another model, but one that's been trained on lots of anime illustrations and art\n\n[Image]\n\nDefault model (left) vs Niji (right)\n\n#### Image parameters\n\n  * --aspect or --ar will change the ratio of width to height of the images. The default is 1:1 but 3:2, 16:9, 16:10, and others are supported.\n  * --chaos [0 to 100] will alter how 'creative' the images will be, with higher values giving you increasingly more oddball results\n  * --stylize or --s [0 to 1000] adjusts how closely the generator sticks to the prompt. The default value is 100 in model v4, and higher values produce images that are less bound to the descriptor.\n  * --quality or --q [0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2] controls how much GPU processing time is allocated to making the image. The default value 1, so if you want to save some precious Midjourney usage time, while experimenting with prompts, using a lower value is really key. The value of 2 only applies to model version 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThere are more commands and parameters to explore, you can head over to the Midjourney website for further details.\n\n## Using images instead of prompts\n\nMidjourney can also use images, instead of text, to create new pieces of art.

Some require a PC equipped with a high-end, expensive graphics card, but Midjourney stands out from the crowd as it needs no specialized hardware at all.\n\nMidjourney runs entirely from a Discord server, opening up the AI art world to millions of people. If you want to join them, continue reading our quick guide on using this fantastic tool.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe first thing you will need is a Discord account \u2013 you can download and use the dedicated app or simply do it via your web browser. That means you can use Midjourney on most devices running Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, or Android.\n\nOnce you are on Discord, join the Midjourney server.\n\nEssentially, what you're going to do is \"chat\" with the Midjourney bot. All messages, for generating images, start with /imagine prompt. The example you can see below was created by sending: /imagine prompt astronaut on a horse to the bot.\n\n[Image]\n\nOnce you're in, you'll see a long list of channels, but for now head for one of the Newcomer Rooms. Here you will see other members making prompts and the resulting images. It will give you a first glimpse of the platform and let you become familiar with the tool.\n\nThere used to be a free trial for new users to experiment with Midjourney, but due to the immense demand it placed on the servers, this has been removed. As a result, you'll need a subscription plan to access everything. Occasionally, a free trial is offered, most notably when a new AI model is released, but it's relatively infrequent. We'll revisit the topic of subscriptions later, and for the remainder of this guide, we'll assume you have the most basic plan.\n\nMidjourney always generates 4 images from the prompts and gives you three options:\n\n  * Redo the whole process to get a new set (the blue double-arrow button)\n  * Upscale one of the four pictures (the U1, U2, U3, U4 buttons)\n  * Use one of the four as a starting template for another run (the V1, V2, V3, V4 buttons).\n\nIt takes a couple of minutes to compose images; however, depending on the server's workload, there might be a longer pause before you can receive your results. With so many people in the channels, your results will quickly scroll out of view, so be sure to keep an eye out for them.\n\n## Using commands and prompt parameters\n\nThe AI image generator supports a number of commands and parameters to adjust what and how it manages the process, most of which you add after the descriptive text. You don't need to use these, as by default, Midjourney will use the latest public model (version 5.1) and create 512 x 512 pictures (older models are 256 x 256).\n\nThe differences between the various models lie mainly in two aspects \u2013 how effectively they interpret the prompt and how accurately the generated image corresponds to the input text (a property known as coherency).\n\n[Image]\n\n\"Vibrant California poppies\" v4 (left) versus v5 (right).\n\nThe more recent Midjourney versions (4, 5, and 5.1) all have very high coherency, though version 4's strength is with image-based prompts; version 5 and 5.1 are extremely good at handling natural text prompts.\n\nVersion 3 has moderate coherency, and the others are all rated as low. That might sound like a bad thing, but if you're after a creative/abstract interpretation of your prompt, then the older models are perfect for this.\n\n#### Model parameters\n\n  * --version or --v will change which deep learning model gets used. Leave a space after the last letter and then add 1, 2, 3, etc.\n  * --style can be used to tweak model version 4 (e.g. --style 4b) if you're looking for further variations on the same theme\n  * --niji is another model, but one that's been trained on lots of anime illustrations and art\n\n[Image]\n\nDefault model (left) vs Niji (right)\n\n#### Image parameters\n\n  * --aspect or --ar will change the ratio of width to height of the images. The default is 1:1 but 3:2, 16:9, 16:10, and others are supported.\n  * --chaos [0 to 100] will alter how 'creative' the images will be, with higher values giving you increasingly more oddball results\n  * --stylize or --s [0 to 1000] adjusts how closely the generator sticks to the prompt. The default value is 100 in model v4, and higher values produce images that are less bound to the descriptor.\n  * --quality or --q [0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2] controls how much GPU processing time is allocated to making the image. The default value 1, so if you want to save some precious Midjourney usage time, while experimenting with prompts, using a lower value is really key. The value of 2 only applies to model version 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThere are more commands and parameters to explore, you can head over to the Midjourney website for further details.\n\n## Using images instead of prompts\n\nMidjourney can also use images, instead of text, to create new pieces of art. Instead of typing /imagine, use /blend and then upload up to 5 pictures from your storage drive into Discord.\n\nThe blend function works best\nVisible: 0% - 42%", "pub_date": "2023-05-10"}], "original_query": null}, "command": "quote", "args": ["Using images instead of prompts", "upload up to 5 pictures from your storage drive into Discord."], "status": "finished", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "ce023381-3c04-41fb-b5d8-7f13182d94ac", "children": ["32ba741e-1003-4dd8-a256-543924539153"]}, "32ba741e-1003-4dd8-a256-543924539153": {"id": "32ba741e-1003-4dd8-a256-543924539153", "message": {"id": "32ba741e-1003-4dd8-a256-543924539153", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383566.213545, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "click(5)"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "82a8c619-833f-47b6-9f11-053e1b9f0172", "children": ["7ab6ac2e-4017-4f62-895f-315514506e1e"]}, "7ab6ac2e-4017-4f62-895f-315514506e1e": {"id": "7ab6ac2e-4017-4f62-895f-315514506e1e", "message": {"id": "7ab6ac2e-4017-4f62-895f-315514506e1e", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383566.213879, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_browsing_display", "result": "\nURL: https://www.techspot.com/guides/2590-install-stable-diffusion/\nPublication Date: 2022-02-18\n  \n\n  * \u30100\u2020User login User icon Login\u3011 \n  *   \n\n  *  Search A search icon    \n\n \u30101\u2020  TechSpot logo The word TechSpot \u3011 \n\n  * \u30102\u2020Trending\u3011 \n\n    * \u30103\u2020Ryzen 7600 vs Ryzen 5600\u3011\n    * \u30104\u2020Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti\u3011\n    * \u30105\u2020Stable Diffusion How-To\u3011\n    * \u30106\u2020Radeon 7900 XT vs RTX 4070 Ti\u3011\n    * \u30107\u2020Steam Deck Gaming\u3011\n\n  * \u30108\u2020Features\u3011 \n\n    * \u30109\u2020Tech Culture\u3011\n    * \u301010\u2020Must Reads\u3011\n    * \u301011\u2020Hardware\u3011\n    * \u301012\u2020Software\u3011\n    * \u301013\u2020Gaming\u3011\n    * \u301014\u2020Explainers\u3011\n    * \u301015\u2020Tips & Tricks\u3011\n\n  * \u301016\u2020Reviews\u3011 \n\n    * \u301017\u2020CPU\u3011\n    * \u301018\u2020Graphics Cards\u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Laptops\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020Storage\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Monitors\u3011\n    * \u301016\u2020More Reviews\u3011\n\n  * \u301022\u2020The Best\u3011 \n\n    * \u301023\u2020Best CPUs\u3011\n    * \u301024\u2020Best Graphics Cards\u3011\n    * \u301025\u2020Best Monitors\u3011\n    * \u301026\u2020Best Software\u3011\n    * \u301027\u2020Best SSD\u3011\n    * \u301028\u2020Best PC Speakers\u3011\n\n  * \u301029\u2020Downloads\u3011 \n\n    * \u301029\u2020Latest Updates\u3011\n    * \u301030\u2020Popular Apps\u3011\n    * \u301031\u2020Software We Recommend\u3011\n    * \u301032\u2020Drivers\u3011\n\n  * \u301033\u2020Product Finder\u3011 \n\nSearch\n\n  * \u301034\u2020Forums\u3011 \n\n    * \u301035\u2020Join TechSpot Elite\u3011\n    * \u301036\u2020New Posts\u3011\n    * \u301037\u2020Latest Comments\u3011\n\n  * \u301038\u2020Jobs\u2020jobs.techspot.com\u3011 \n\n  * \u301039\u2020Software\u3011 \n  * \u301040\u2020Tech Culture\u3011 \n\n# How to Run Stable Diffusion on Your PC to Generate AI Images\n\n## Dive Into the World of AI Image Generation\n\nBy  \u301041\u2020Nick Evanson\u3011  February 18, 2022 \n\n  [Image] \n\nTechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary.

One such map is called Stable Diffusion and since it made an appearance, it's been the subject of wonder, derision, and fervent use.\n\nAnd best of all, you can use it, too, thanks to our detailed guide on how to use Stable Diffusion to generate AI images and more besides!\n\n## What exactly is Stable Diffusion?\n\nStable Diffusion is a deep learning algorithm that uses text as an input to create a rendered image. A longer answer to that same question is more complex: it involves computer-based neural networks that have been trained with selected datasets from the \u301078\u2020LAION-5B\u2020laion.ai\u3011 project \u2013 a collection of 5 billion images and an associated caption. The end result is something that, when given a few words, the machine learning model calculates and then renders the most likely image that best fits them.\n\nStable Diffusion is unusual in its field because the developers made the source code and the model weights publicly available (a collaboration between \u301079\u2020Stability AI\u2020stability.ai\u3011, the \u301080\u2020Computer Vision & Learning Group\u2020ommer-lab.com\u3011 at LMU Munich, and \u301081\u2020Runway AI\u2020runwayml.com\u3011).\n\nModel weights are essentially a very large data array that controls how much the input affects the output.\n\n[Image]\n\nA tiny fraction of the images in the LAION-5B database\n\nThere are two major releases of Stable Diffusion \u2013 version 1 and version 2. The main differences lie in the datasets used to train the models and the text encoder. There are four primary models available for version 1:\n\n  * SD v1.1 = created from 237,000 training steps at a resolution of 256 x 256, using the laion2b-en subset of LAION-5B (2.3 billion images with English descriptions), followed by 194,000 training steps at a resolution of 512 x 512 using the laion-high-resolution subset (0.2b images with resolutions greater than 1024 x 1024).\n  * SD v1.2 = additional training of SD v1.1 with 515,000 steps at 512 x 512 using the laion-improved-aesthetics subset of laion2B-en, adjusted to select images with higher aesthetics and those without watermarks\n  * SD v1.3 = further training of SD v1.2 using around 200k steps, at 512 x 512, of the same dataset as above, but with some \u301082\u2020additional math\u2020benanne.github.io\u3011 going on behind the scenes\n  * SD v1.4 = another round of 225k steps of SD v1.3\n\nFor \u301083\u2020version 2\u2020huggingface.co\u3011, all of the datasets and neural networks used were open-source and differed in image content.\n\nThe update wasn't \u301084\u2020without criticism\u2020towardsdatascience.com\u3011 but it can produce superior results \u2013 the base model can be used to make images that are 768 x 768 in size (compared to 512 x 512 in v1) and there's even a model for making 2k images.\n\n[Image]\n\nWhen getting started in AI image generation, though, it doesn't matter what model you use. With the right hardware, a bit of computing knowledge, and plenty of spare time to explore it, anyone can download the relevant files and get stuck in.\n\n## Getting started with AI image creation\n\nIf you want a quick and simple go at using Stable Diffusion without getting your hands dirty, you can \u301085\u2020try a demo of it here\u2020huggingface.co\u3011.\n\nYou have two text fields to complete: the first is a positive prompt that tell the algorithm to focus on those input words. The second, a negative prompt, tells the algorithm to remove such items from the image it is about to generate.\n\n[Image]\n\nThere's one additional thing you can alter in this simple demo.\n\nUnder Advanced Options, the higher guidance scale is, the more rigidly the algorithm will stick to the input words. Set this too high and you'll end up with an unholy mess, but it's still worth experimenting to see what you can get.\n\nThe demo is rather limited and slow because the calculations are being done on a server. If you want more control over the output, then you'll need to download\nVisible: 0% - 23%", "summary": "www.techspot.com (www.techspot.com)\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"title": "www.techspot.com", "url": "https://www.techspot.com/guides/2590-install-stable-diffusion/", "text": "\nURL: https://www.techspot.com/guides/2590-install-stable-diffusion/\nPublication Date: 2022-02-18\n  \n\n  * User login User icon Login \n  *   \n\n  *  Search A search icon    \n\n   TechSpot logo The word TechSpot  \n\n  * Trending \n\n    * Ryzen 7600 vs Ryzen 5600\n    * Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Stable Diffusion How-To\n    * Radeon 7900 XT vs RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Steam Deck Gaming\n\n  * Features \n\n    * Tech Culture\n    * Must Reads\n    * Hardware\n    * Software\n    * Gaming\n    * Explainers\n    * Tips & Tricks\n\n  * Reviews \n\n    * CPU\n    * Graphics Cards\n    * Laptops\n    * Storage\n    * Monitors\n    * More Reviews\n\n  * The Best \n\n    * Best CPUs\n    * Best Graphics Cards\n    * Best Monitors\n    * Best Software\n    * Best SSD\n    * Best PC Speakers\n\n  * Downloads \n\n    * Latest Updates\n    * Popular Apps\n    * Software We Recommend\n    * Drivers\n\n  * Product Finder \n\nSearch\n\n  * Forums \n\n    * Join TechSpot Elite\n    * New Posts\n    * Latest Comments\n\n  * Jobs \n\n  * Software \n  * Tech Culture \n\n# How to Run Stable Diffusion on Your PC to Generate AI Images\n\n## Dive Into the World of AI Image Generation\n\nBy  Nick Evanson  February 18, 2022 \n\n  [Image] \n\nTechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary.

One such map is called Stable Diffusion and since it made an appearance, it's been the subject of wonder, derision, and fervent use.\n\nAnd best of all, you can use it, too, thanks to our detailed guide on how to use Stable Diffusion to generate AI images and more besides!\n\n## What exactly is Stable Diffusion?\n\nStable Diffusion is a deep learning algorithm that uses text as an input to create a rendered image. A longer answer to that same question is more complex: it involves computer-based neural networks that have been trained with selected datasets from the LAION-5B project \u2013 a collection of 5 billion images and an associated caption. The end result is something that, when given a few words, the machine learning model calculates and then renders the most likely image that best fits them.\n\nStable Diffusion is unusual in its field because the developers made the source code and the model weights publicly available (a collaboration between Stability AI, the Computer Vision & Learning Group at LMU Munich, and Runway AI).\n\nModel weights are essentially a very large data array that controls how much the input affects the output.\n\n[Image]\n\nA tiny fraction of the images in the LAION-5B database\n\nThere are two major releases of Stable Diffusion \u2013 version 1 and version 2. The main differences lie in the datasets used to train the models and the text encoder. There are four primary models available for version 1:\n\n  * SD v1.1 = created from 237,000 training steps at a resolution of 256 x 256, using the laion2b-en subset of LAION-5B (2.3 billion images with English descriptions), followed by 194,000 training steps at a resolution of 512 x 512 using the laion-high-resolution subset (0.2b images with resolutions greater than 1024 x 1024).\n  * SD v1.2 = additional training of SD v1.1 with 515,000 steps at 512 x 512 using the laion-improved-aesthetics subset of laion2B-en, adjusted to select images with higher aesthetics and those without watermarks\n  * SD v1.3 = further training of SD v1.2 using around 200k steps, at 512 x 512, of the same dataset as above, but with some additional math going on behind the scenes\n  * SD v1.4 = another round of 225k steps of SD v1.3\n\nFor version 2, all of the datasets and neural networks used were open-source and differed in image content.\n\nThe update wasn't without criticism but it can produce superior results \u2013 the base model can be used to make images that are 768 x 768 in size (compared to 512 x 512 in v1) and there's even a model for making 2k images.\n\n[Image]\n\nWhen getting started in AI image generation, though, it doesn't matter what model you use. With the right hardware, a bit of computing knowledge, and plenty of spare time to explore it, anyone can download the relevant files and get stuck in.\n\n## Getting started with AI image creation\n\nIf you want a quick and simple go at using Stable Diffusion without getting your hands dirty, you can try a demo of it here.\n\nYou have two text fields to complete: the first is a positive prompt that tell the algorithm to focus on those input words. The second, a negative prompt, tells the algorithm to remove such items from the image it is about to generate.\n\n[Image]\n\nThere's one additional thing you can alter in this simple demo.\n\nUnder Advanced Options, the higher guidance scale is, the more rigidly the algorithm will stick to the input words. Set this too high and you'll end up with an unholy mess, but it's still worth experimenting to see what you can get.\n\nThe demo is rather limited and slow because the calculations are being done on a server. If you want more control over the output, then you'll need to download\nVisible: 0% - 23%", "pub_date": "2022-02-18"}], "original_query": null}, "command": "click", "args": [5], "status": "finished", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "32ba741e-1003-4dd8-a256-543924539153", "children": ["cdafc789-9678-4d62-86b7-1b2a92aa9a05"]}, "cdafc789-9678-4d62-86b7-1b2a92aa9a05": {"id": "cdafc789-9678-4d62-86b7-1b2a92aa9a05", "message": {"id": "cdafc789-9678-4d62-86b7-1b2a92aa9a05", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383566.214246, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "click(1)"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "7ab6ac2e-4017-4f62-895f-315514506e1e", "children": ["7a26cd19-ce13-46ce-81be-42b5598a0f87"]}, "7a26cd19-ce13-46ce-81be-42b5598a0f87": {"id": "7a26cd19-ce13-46ce-81be-42b5598a0f87", "message": {"id": "7a26cd19-ce13-46ce-81be-42b5598a0f87", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383566.214804, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_browsing_display", "result": "\nURL: https://www.techspot.com/\nPublication Date: 2023-05-17\n  \n\n  * \u30100\u2020User login User icon Login\u3011 \n  *   \n\n  *  Search A search icon    \n\n \u30101\u2020  TechSpot logo The word TechSpot \u3011 \n\n  * \u30102\u2020Trending\u3011 \n\n    * \u30103\u2020Ryzen 7600 vs Ryzen 5600\u3011\n    * \u30104\u2020Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti\u3011\n    * \u30105\u2020Stable Diffusion How-To\u3011\n    * \u30106\u2020Radeon 7900 XT vs RTX 4070 Ti\u3011\n    * \u30107\u2020Steam Deck Gaming\u3011\n\n  * \u30108\u2020Features\u3011 \n\n    * \u30109\u2020Tech Culture\u3011\n    * \u301010\u2020Must Reads\u3011\n    * \u301011\u2020Hardware\u3011\n    * \u301012\u2020Software\u3011\n    * \u301013\u2020Gaming\u3011\n    * \u301014\u2020Explainers\u3011\n    * \u301015\u2020Tips & Tricks\u3011\n\n  * \u301016\u2020Reviews\u3011 \n\n    * \u301017\u2020CPU\u3011\n    * \u301018\u2020Graphics Cards\u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Laptops\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020Storage\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Monitors\u3011\n    * \u301016\u2020More Reviews\u3011\n\n  * \u301022\u2020The Best\u3011 \n\n    * \u301023\u2020Best CPUs\u3011\n    * \u301024\u2020Best Graphics Cards\u3011\n    * \u301025\u2020Best Monitors\u3011\n    * \u301026\u2020Best Software\u3011\n    * \u301027\u2020Best SSD\u3011\n    * \u301028\u2020Best PC Speakers\u3011\n\n  * \u301029\u2020Downloads\u3011 \n\n    * \u301029\u2020Latest Updates\u3011\n    * \u301030\u2020Popular Apps\u3011\n    * \u301031\u2020Software We Recommend\u3011\n    * \u301032\u2020Drivers\u3011\n\n  * \u301033\u2020Product Finder\u3011 \n\nSearch\n\n  * \u301034\u2020Forums\u3011 \n\n    * \u301035\u2020Join TechSpot Elite\u3011\n    * \u301036\u2020New Posts\u3011\n    * \u301037\u2020Latest Comments\u3011\n\n  * \u301038\u2020Jobs\u2020jobs.techspot.com\u3011 \n\n  * \u301039\u2020 CD-ROM What Ever Happened to Microsoft Encarta? \u3011 \n\n  * \u301040\u2020 OVERCLOCKING Enthusiast proves AMD's Radeon 7900 XTX can reach RTX 4090-like performance levels \u3011 \n\n  * \u301041\u2020 SECURITY Hackers are infecting TP-Link routers with malicious firmware \u3011 \n\n  * \u301042\u2020 40 GAME BENCHMARK GeForce RTX 4070 vs. RTX 2070: Worthy Upgrade or Not? \u3011 \n\n  * \u301043\u2020 WTF?!

Based on the AD104 silicon, there's 7680 CUDA cores, just 21% fewer cores than the \u301064\u20204080\u3011, but they are clocked 4% higher. Then we see a 25% reduction to the L2 cache capacity and a 25% reduction in VRAM with slightly slower 21Gbps memory used, and a 192-bit wide memory bus that has cut bandwidth by 30% down to 504 GB/s.\n\n[Image]\n\nWe're also looking at a modest 11% reduction in total board power with a rating of 285 watts. Other than that Nvidia's still using the TSMC 4N process and supports the PCIe 4.0 x16 interface.\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 GeForce RTX 4080 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GeForce RTX 3080 Ti  \nPrice  \n[$US MSRP] \u301065\u2020$1,600\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011 \u301066\u2020$1,200\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011 \u301067\u2020$800\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011 \u301068\u2020$2,000\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011 \u301069\u2020$1,200\u2020www.amazon.com\u3011  \nRelease Date October 12, 2022 November 16, 2022 January 5, 2023 March 29, 2022 June 3, 2021  \nCodename AD102 AD103 AD104 GA102  \nProcess TSMC 4N Samsung 8LPP  \nCores 16384 / 512 / 176 9728 / 304 / 112 7680 / 240 / 80 10752 / 336 / 112 10240 / 320 / 112  \nGPU Boost Clock 2520 MHz 2505 MHz 2610 MHz 1860 MHz 1665 MHz  \nMemory Capacity / Type 24GB / GDDR6X 16GB / GDDR6X 12GB / GDDR6X 24GB / GDDR6X 12GB / GDDR6X  \nMemory Speed 21 Gbps 22.4 Gbps 21 Gbps 21 Gbps 19 Gbps  \nBus Type / Bandwidth 384-bit / 1008 GB/s 256-bit / 717 GB/s 192-bit / 504 GB/s 384-bit / 1008 GB/s 384-bit / 912 GB/s  \nTotal Board Power 450 watts 320 watts 285 watts 450 watts 350 watts  \n\nThere is no Founders Edition model for the 4070 Ti, instead Nvidia is letting their partners handle the board designs and on hand for testing we have a number of graphics cards from Gigabyte, MSI and Asus, which we'll look at later on. For now, let's go straight to our test system specs and jump into the blue bar graphs.\n\n[Image]\n\nNvidia's super misleading graph: up to three times the performance ** but ** comparing regular rendering on the RTX 3090 Ti vs. \u301070\u2020DLSS 3\u3011 on the RTX 4070 Ti. No footnotes to indicate that clearly. Nvidia has a good enough product that they don't need this kind of misleading practice. Poor marketing that raises suspicions in our opinion.\n\n[Image]\n\nFor testing we powered our system using the \u301071\u2020Ryzen 7 5800X3D\u3011 with 32GB of dual-rank, dual-channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory on the MSI MPG X570S Carbon Max Wi-Fi motherboard. In total we've tested 16 games at 1440p and 4K, so let's get into the data...\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nStarting with Watch Dogs: Legion results, we see that the RTX 4070 Ti is comparable to the \u301072\u20206950 XT\u3011 with 146 fps on average at 1440p. That's certainly not a bad result as it does make it 11% faster than the \u301073\u2020RTX 3090 Ti\u3011 and just 5% slower than the RTX 4080, though we are CPU limited here.\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving to 4K sees the RTX 4070 Ti trailing the \u301074\u20207900 XT\u3011 by 12% for what's once again \u301072\u20206950 XT\u3011-like performance, and RTX 3090 Ti-like as well. Perhaps more importantly, it was just 19% slower than the RTX 4080 which is nice given it's 33% more affordable.\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving on to The Callisto Protocol, here the RTX 4070 Ti pumped out 122 fps which did make it quite a bit slower than the 7900 XT, 17% slower at 1440p. We should also note that this game enables FSR2 by default with the ultra quality preset, so that's why it's enabled here, this isn't something we've manually changed.\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving to 4K sees\nVisible: 0% - 24%", "summary": "www.techspot.com (www.techspot.com)\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"title": "www.techspot.com", "url": "https://www.techspot.com/review/2601-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti/", "text": "\nURL: https://www.techspot.com/review/2601-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti/\nPublication Date: 2023-01-04\n  \n\n  * User login User icon Login \n  *   \n\n  *  Search A search icon    \n\n   TechSpot logo The word TechSpot  \n\n  * Trending \n\n    * Ryzen 7600 vs Ryzen 5600\n    * Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Stable Diffusion How-To\n    * Radeon 7900 XT vs RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Steam Deck Gaming\n\n  * Features \n\n    * Tech Culture\n    * Must Reads\n    * Hardware\n    * Software\n    * Gaming\n    * Explainers\n    * Tips & Tricks\n\n  * Reviews \n\n    * CPU\n    * Graphics Cards\n    * Laptops\n    * Storage\n    * Monitors\n    * More Reviews\n\n  * The Best \n\n    * Best CPUs\n    * Best Graphics Cards\n    * Best Monitors\n    * Best Software\n    * Best SSD\n    * Best PC Speakers\n\n  * Downloads \n\n    * Latest Updates\n    * Popular Apps\n    * Software We Recommend\n    * Drivers\n\n  * Product Finder \n\nSearch\n\n  * Forums \n\n    * Join TechSpot Elite\n    * New Posts\n    * Latest Comments\n\n  * Jobs \n\n  * Reviews \n  * Graphics \n\n# Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Review\n\n## Can It Hit the Mainstream at $800?\n\nBy  Steven Walton  January 4, 2023 \n\n  [Image] \n\n80\n\nTechSpot score\n\nTechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary.

Based on the AD104 silicon, there's 7680 CUDA cores, just 21% fewer cores than the 4080, but they are clocked 4% higher. Then we see a 25% reduction to the L2 cache capacity and a 25% reduction in VRAM with slightly slower 21Gbps memory used, and a 192-bit wide memory bus that has cut bandwidth by 30% down to 504 GB/s.\n\n[Image]\n\nWe're also looking at a modest 11% reduction in total board power with a rating of 285 watts. Other than that Nvidia's still using the TSMC 4N process and supports the PCIe 4.0 x16 interface.\n\nGeForce RTX 4090 GeForce RTX 4080 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GeForce RTX 3080 Ti  \nPrice  \n[$US MSRP] $1,600 $1,200 $800 $2,000 $1,200  \nRelease Date October 12, 2022 November 16, 2022 January 5, 2023 March 29, 2022 June 3, 2021  \nCodename AD102 AD103 AD104 GA102  \nProcess TSMC 4N Samsung 8LPP  \nCores 16384 / 512 / 176 9728 / 304 / 112 7680 / 240 / 80 10752 / 336 / 112 10240 / 320 / 112  \nGPU Boost Clock 2520 MHz 2505 MHz 2610 MHz 1860 MHz 1665 MHz  \nMemory Capacity / Type 24GB / GDDR6X 16GB / GDDR6X 12GB / GDDR6X 24GB / GDDR6X 12GB / GDDR6X  \nMemory Speed 21 Gbps 22.4 Gbps 21 Gbps 21 Gbps 19 Gbps  \nBus Type / Bandwidth 384-bit / 1008 GB/s 256-bit / 717 GB/s 192-bit / 504 GB/s 384-bit / 1008 GB/s 384-bit / 912 GB/s  \nTotal Board Power 450 watts 320 watts 285 watts 450 watts 350 watts  \n\nThere is no Founders Edition model for the 4070 Ti, instead Nvidia is letting their partners handle the board designs and on hand for testing we have a number of graphics cards from Gigabyte, MSI and Asus, which we'll look at later on. For now, let's go straight to our test system specs and jump into the blue bar graphs.\n\n[Image]\n\nNvidia's super misleading graph: up to three times the performance ** but ** comparing regular rendering on the RTX 3090 Ti vs. DLSS 3 on the RTX 4070 Ti. No footnotes to indicate that clearly. Nvidia has a good enough product that they don't need this kind of misleading practice. Poor marketing that raises suspicions in our opinion.\n\n[Image]\n\nFor testing we powered our system using the Ryzen 7 5800X3D with 32GB of dual-rank, dual-channel DDR4-3200 CL14 memory on the MSI MPG X570S Carbon Max Wi-Fi motherboard. In total we've tested 16 games at 1440p and 4K, so let's get into the data...\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nStarting with Watch Dogs: Legion results, we see that the RTX 4070 Ti is comparable to the 6950 XT with 146 fps on average at 1440p.

That's certainly not a bad result as it does make it 11% faster than the \u301073\u2020RTX 3090 Ti\u3011 and just 5% slower than the RTX 4080, though we are CPU limited here.\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving to 4K sees the RTX 4070 Ti trailing the \u301074\u20207900 XT\u3011 by 12% for what's once again \u301072\u20206950 XT\u3011-like performance, and RTX 3090 Ti-like as well. Perhaps more importantly, it was just 19% slower than the RTX 4080 which is nice given it's 33% more affordable.\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving on to The Callisto Protocol, here the RTX 4070 Ti pumped out 122 fps which did make it quite a bit slower than the 7900 XT, 17% slower at 1440p. We should also note that this game enables FSR2 by default with the ultra quality preset, so that's why it's enabled here, this isn't something we've manually changed.\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving to 4K sees\nVisible: 0% - 24%", "summary": "www.techspot.com (www.techspot.com)\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"title": "www.techspot.com", "url": "https://www.techspot.com/review/2601-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti/", "text": "\nURL: https://www.techspot.com/review/2601-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti/\nPublication Date: 2023-01-04\n  \n\n  * User login User icon Login \n  *   \n\n  *  Search A search icon    \n\n   TechSpot logo The word TechSpot  \n\n  * Trending \n\n    * Ryzen 7600 vs Ryzen 5600\n    * Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Stable Diffusion How-To\n    * Radeon 7900 XT vs RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Steam Deck Gaming\n\n  * Features \n\n    * Tech Culture\n    * Must Reads\n    * Hardware\n    * Software\n    * Gaming\n    * Explainers\n    * Tips & Tricks\n\n  * Reviews \n\n    * CPU\n    * Graphics Cards\n    * Laptops\n    * Storage\n    * Monitors\n    * More Reviews\n\n  * The Best \n\n    * Best CPUs\n    * Best Graphics Cards\n    * Best Monitors\n    * Best Software\n    * Best SSD\n    * Best PC Speakers\n\n  * Downloads \n\n    * Latest Updates\n    * Popular Apps\n    * Software We Recommend\n    * Drivers\n\n  * Product Finder \n\nSearch\n\n  * Forums \n\n    * Join TechSpot Elite\n    * New Posts\n    * Latest Comments\n\n  * Jobs \n\n  * Reviews \n  * Graphics \n\n# Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Review\n\n## Can It Hit the Mainstream at $800?\n\nBy  Steven Walton  January 4, 2023 \n\n  [Image] \n\n80\n\nTechSpot score\n\nTechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary.

We should also note that this game enables FSR2 by default with the ultra quality preset, so that's why it's enabled here, this isn't something we've manually changed.\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving to 4K sees\nVisible: 0% - 24%", "pub_date": "2023-01-04"}], "original_query": null}, "command": "click", "args": [4], "status": "finished", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "71c854f5-d1dc-441e-9167-3e5916cfc35b", "children": ["9d058682-11c6-4ade-aec0-486abc83a336"]}, "9d058682-11c6-4ade-aec0-486abc83a336": {"id": "9d058682-11c6-4ade-aec0-486abc83a336", "message": {"id": "9d058682-11c6-4ade-aec0-486abc83a336", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383566.221109, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "click(1)"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "e0edbca2-6b4b-4b70-ba64-805c540470bc", "children": ["93f08e0e-05f9-4fd7-a888-ebd78b46eb7f"]}, "93f08e0e-05f9-4fd7-a888-ebd78b46eb7f": {"id": "93f08e0e-05f9-4fd7-a888-ebd78b46eb7f", "message": {"id": "93f08e0e-05f9-4fd7-a888-ebd78b46eb7f", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383566.221631, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_browsing_display", "result": "\nURL: https://www.techspot.com/\nPublication Date: 2023-05-17\n  \n\n  * \u30100\u2020User login User icon Login\u3011 \n  *   \n\n  *  Search A search icon    \n\n \u30101\u2020  TechSpot logo The word TechSpot \u3011 \n\n  * \u30102\u2020Trending\u3011 \n\n    * \u30103\u2020Ryzen 7600 vs Ryzen 5600\u3011\n    * \u30104\u2020Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti\u3011\n    * \u30105\u2020Stable Diffusion How-To\u3011\n    * \u30106\u2020Radeon 7900 XT vs RTX 4070 Ti\u3011\n    * \u30107\u2020Steam Deck Gaming\u3011\n\n  * \u30108\u2020Features\u3011 \n\n    * \u30109\u2020Tech Culture\u3011\n    * \u301010\u2020Must Reads\u3011\n    * \u301011\u2020Hardware\u3011\n    * \u301012\u2020Software\u3011\n    * \u301013\u2020Gaming\u3011\n    * \u301014\u2020Explainers\u3011\n    * \u301015\u2020Tips & Tricks\u3011\n\n  * \u301016\u2020Reviews\u3011 \n\n    * \u301017\u2020CPU\u3011\n    * \u301018\u2020Graphics Cards\u3011\n    * \u301019\u2020Laptops\u3011\n    * \u301020\u2020Storage\u3011\n    * \u301021\u2020Monitors\u3011\n    * \u301016\u2020More Reviews\u3011\n\n  * \u301022\u2020The Best\u3011 \n\n    * \u301023\u2020Best CPUs\u3011\n    * \u301024\u2020Best Graphics Cards\u3011\n    * \u301025\u2020Best Monitors\u3011\n    * \u301026\u2020Best Software\u3011\n    * \u301027\u2020Best SSD\u3011\n    * \u301028\u2020Best PC Speakers\u3011\n\n  * \u301029\u2020Downloads\u3011 \n\n    * \u301029\u2020Latest Updates\u3011\n    * \u301030\u2020Popular Apps\u3011\n    * \u301031\u2020Software We Recommend\u3011\n    * \u301032\u2020Drivers\u3011\n\n  * \u301033\u2020Product Finder\u3011 \n\nSearch\n\n  * \u301034\u2020Forums\u3011 \n\n    * \u301035\u2020Join TechSpot Elite\u3011\n    * \u301036\u2020New Posts\u3011\n    * \u301037\u2020Latest Comments\u3011\n\n  * \u301038\u2020Jobs\u2020jobs.techspot.com\u3011 \n\n  * \u301039\u2020 CD-ROM What Ever Happened to Microsoft Encarta? \u3011 \n\n  * \u301040\u2020 OVERCLOCKING Enthusiast proves AMD's Radeon 7900 XTX can reach RTX 4090-like performance levels \u3011 \n\n  * \u301041\u2020 SECURITY Hackers are infecting TP-Link routers with malicious firmware \u3011 \n\n  * \u301042\u2020 40 GAME BENCHMARK GeForce RTX 4070 vs. RTX 2070: Worthy Upgrade or Not? \u3011 \n\n  * \u301043\u2020 WTF?!

One such map is called Stable Diffusion and since it made an appearance, it's been the subject of wonder, derision, and fervent use.\n\nAnd best of all, you can use it, too, thanks to our detailed guide on how to use Stable Diffusion to generate AI images and more besides!\n\n## What exactly is Stable Diffusion?\n\nStable Diffusion is a deep learning algorithm that uses text as an input to create a rendered image. A longer answer to that same question is more complex: it involves computer-based neural networks that have been trained with selected datasets from the \u301078\u2020LAION-5B\u2020laion.ai\u3011 project \u2013 a collection of 5 billion images and an associated caption. The end result is something that, when given a few words, the machine learning model calculates and then renders the most likely image that best fits them.\n\nStable Diffusion is unusual in its field because the developers made the source code and the model weights publicly available (a collaboration between \u301079\u2020Stability AI\u2020stability.ai\u3011, the \u301080\u2020Computer Vision & Learning Group\u2020ommer-lab.com\u3011 at LMU Munich, and \u301081\u2020Runway AI\u2020runwayml.com\u3011).\n\nModel weights are essentially a very large data array that controls how much the input affects the output.\n\n[Image]\n\nA tiny fraction of the images in the LAION-5B database\n\nThere are two major releases of Stable Diffusion \u2013 version 1 and version 2. The main differences lie in the datasets used to train the models and the text encoder. There are four primary models available for version 1:\n\n  * SD v1.1 = created from 237,000 training steps at a resolution of 256 x 256, using the laion2b-en subset of LAION-5B (2.3 billion images with English descriptions), followed by 194,000 training steps at a resolution of 512 x 512 using the laion-high-resolution subset (0.2b images with resolutions greater than 1024 x 1024).\n  * SD v1.2 = additional training of SD v1.1 with 515,000 steps at 512 x 512 using the laion-improved-aesthetics subset of laion2B-en, adjusted to select images with higher aesthetics and those without watermarks\n  * SD v1.3 = further training of SD v1.2 using around 200k steps, at 512 x 512, of the same dataset as above, but with some \u301082\u2020additional math\u2020benanne.github.io\u3011 going on behind the scenes\n  * SD v1.4 = another round of 225k steps of SD v1.3\n\nFor \u301083\u2020version 2\u2020huggingface.co\u3011, all of the datasets and neural networks used were open-source and differed in image content.\n\nThe update wasn't \u301084\u2020without criticism\u2020towardsdatascience.com\u3011 but it can produce superior results \u2013 the base model can be used to make images that are 768 x 768 in size (compared to 512 x 512 in v1) and there's even a model for making 2k images.\n\n[Image]\n\nWhen getting started in AI image generation, though, it doesn't matter what model you use. With the right hardware, a bit of computing knowledge, and plenty of spare time to explore it, anyone can download the relevant files and get stuck in.\n\n## Getting started with AI image creation\n\nIf you want a quick and simple go at using Stable Diffusion without getting your hands dirty, you can \u301085\u2020try a demo of it here\u2020huggingface.co\u3011.\n\nYou have two text fields to complete: the first is a positive prompt that tell the algorithm to focus on those input words. The second, a negative prompt, tells the algorithm to remove such items from the image it is about to generate.\n\n[Image]\n\nThere's one additional thing you can alter in this simple demo.\n\nUnder Advanced Options, the higher guidance scale is, the more rigidly the algorithm will stick to the input words. Set this too high and you'll end up with an unholy mess, but it's still worth experimenting to see what you can get.\n\nThe demo is rather limited and slow because the calculations are being done on a server.

Perhaps more importantly, it was just 19% slower than the RTX 4080 which is nice given it's 33% more affordable.\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving on to The Callisto Protocol, here the RTX 4070 Ti pumped out 122 fps which did make it quite a bit slower than the 7900 XT, 17% slower at 1440p. We should also note that this game enables FSR2 by default with the ultra quality preset, so that's why it's enabled here, this isn't something we've manually changed.\n\n[Image]\n\nMoving to 4K sees\nVisible: 0% - 24%", "summary": "www.techspot.com (www.techspot.com)\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"title": "www.techspot.com", "url": "https://www.techspot.com/review/2601-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti/", "text": "\nURL: https://www.techspot.com/review/2601-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti/\nPublication Date: 2023-01-04\n  \n\n  * User login User icon Login \n  *   \n\n  *  Search A search icon    \n\n   TechSpot logo The word TechSpot  \n\n  * Trending \n\n    * Ryzen 7600 vs Ryzen 5600\n    * Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Stable Diffusion How-To\n    * Radeon 7900 XT vs RTX 4070 Ti\n    * Steam Deck Gaming\n\n  * Features \n\n    * Tech Culture\n    * Must Reads\n    * Hardware\n    * Software\n    * Gaming\n    * Explainers\n    * Tips & Tricks\n\n  * Reviews \n\n    * CPU\n    * Graphics Cards\n    * Laptops\n    * Storage\n    * Monitors\n    * More Reviews\n\n  * The Best \n\n    * Best CPUs\n    * Best Graphics Cards\n    * Best Monitors\n    * Best Software\n    * Best SSD\n    * Best PC Speakers\n\n  * Downloads \n\n    * Latest Updates\n    * Popular Apps\n    * Software We Recommend\n    * Drivers\n\n  * Product Finder \n\nSearch\n\n  * Forums \n\n    * Join TechSpot Elite\n    * New Posts\n    * Latest Comments\n\n  * Jobs \n\n  * Reviews \n  * Graphics \n\n# Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Review\n\n## Can It Hit the Mainstream at $800?\n\nBy  Steven Walton  January 4, 2023 \n\n  [Image] \n\n80\n\nTechSpot score\n\nTechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary.

For instance, if you wanted to generate an image of an astronaut on a horse, you would send \"/imagine prompt astronaut on a horse\" to the bot\u301013\u2020source\u3011\u301014\u2020source\u3011\u301017\u2020source\u3011.\n\nMidjourney generates four images from the prompts and gives you three options:\n\n1. Redo the whole process to get a new set.\n2. Upscale one of the four pictures.\n3. Use one of the four as a starting template for another run\u301013\u2020source\u3011\u301014\u2020source\u3011\u301017\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe AI image generator supports a number of commands and parameters to adjust what and how it manages the process. Some of these include:\n\n- `--version` or `--v` to change which deep learning model gets used.\n- `--style` to tweak model version 4 if you're looking for further variations on the same theme.\n- `--niji` to use another model that's been trained on lots of anime illustrations and art.\n- `--aspect` or `--ar` to change the ratio of width to height of the images.\n- `--chaos` to alter how 'creative' the images will be.\n- `--stylize` or `--s` to adjust how closely the generator sticks to the prompt.\n- `--quality` or `--q` to control how much GPU processing time is allocated to making the image\u301015\u2020source\u3011\u301016\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFurthermore, Midjourney can also use images, instead of text, to create new pieces of art. Instead of typing /imagine, you would use /blend and then upload up to 5 pictures from your storage drive into Discord\u301017\u2020source\u3011.\n\nAs for the costs, unfortunately, I couldn't find specific details about the subscription plans and their costs. I would recommend checking the Midjourney Discord server or their official website for the most current and accurate information."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "citations": [{"start_ix": 465, "end_ix": 476, "metadata": {"title": "www.techspot.com", "url": "https://www.techspot.com/guides/2648-midjourney-ai/", "text": "AI-based image generators are hugely popular at the moment, with many options to choose from to scratch that creative itch.

We'll revisit the topic of subscriptions later, and for the remainder of this guide, we'll assume you have the most basic plan.\n\nMidjourney always generates 4 images from the prompts and gives you three options:\n\n  * Redo the whole process to get a new set (the blue double-arrow button)\n  * Upscale one of the four pictures (the U1, U2, U3, U4 buttons)\n  * Use one of the four as a starting template for another run (the V1, V2, V3, V4 buttons).\n\nIt takes a couple of minutes to compose images; however, depending on the server's workload, there might be a longer pause before you can receive your results. With so many people in the channels, your results will quickly scroll out of view, so be sure to keep an eye out for them.\n\n## Using commands and prompt parameters\n\nThe AI image generator supports a number of commands and parameters to adjust what and how it manages the process, most of which you add after the descriptive text. You don't need to use these, as by default, Midjourney will use the latest public model (version 5.1) and create 512 x 512 pictures (older models are 256 x 256).\n\nThe differences between the various models lie mainly in two aspects \u2013 how effectively they interpret the prompt and how accurately the generated image corresponds to the input text (a property known as coherency).\n\n[Image]\n\n\"Vibrant California poppies\" v4 (left) versus v5 (right).\n\nThe more recent Midjourney versions (4, 5, and 5.1) all have very high coherency, though version 4's strength is with image-based prompts; version 5 and 5.1 are extremely good at handling natural text prompts.\n\nVersion 3 has moderate coherency, and the others are all rated as low. That might sound like a bad thing, but if you're after a creative/abstract interpretation of your prompt, then the older models are perfect for this.\n\n#### Model parameters\n\n  * --version or --v will change which deep learning model gets used. Leave a space after the last letter and then add 1, 2, 3, etc.\n  * --style can be used to tweak model version 4 (e.g. --style 4b) if you're looking for further variations on the same theme\n  * --niji is another model, but one that's been trained on lots of anime illustrations and art\n\n[Image]\n\nDefault model (left) vs Niji (right)\n\n#### Image parameters\n\n  * --aspect or --ar will change the ratio of width to height of the images. The default is 1:1 but 3:2, 16:9, 16:10, and others are supported.\n  * --chaos [0 to 100] will alter how 'creative' the images will be, with higher values giving you increasingly more oddball results\n  * --stylize or --s [0 to 1000] adjusts how closely the generator sticks to the prompt. The default value is 100 in model v4, and higher values produce images that are less bound to the descriptor.\n  * --quality or --q [0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2] controls how much GPU processing time is allocated to making the image. The default value 1, so if you want to save some precious Midjourney usage time, while experimenting with prompts, using a lower value is really key. The value of 2 only applies to model version 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThere are more commands and parameters to explore, you can head over to the Midjourney website for further details.\n\n## Using images instead of prompts\n\nMidjourney can also use images, instead of text, to create new pieces of art. Instead of typing /imagine, use /blend and then upload up to 5 pictures from your storage drive into Discord", "pub_date": null}}], "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "3842123e-f7e3-4a3e-9a96-550483b2d7e6", "children": ["aaa281b3-8848-42a6-a9ab-a5651ae1ca9e"]}, "aaa281b3-8848-42a6-a9ab-a5651ae1ca9e": {"id": "aaa281b3-8848-42a6-a9ab-a5651ae1ca9e", "message": {"id": "aaa281b3-8848-42a6-a9ab-a5651ae1ca9e", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383718.494833, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Search and show me 10 good prompts for midjourney "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "7d34b5de-8af7-4107-aca7-5db33b34d482", "children": ["312bb908-8d77-42a4-acf8-164961ccd34f"]}, "312bb908-8d77-42a4-acf8-164961ccd34f": {"id": "312bb908-8d77-42a4-acf8-164961ccd34f", "message": {"id": "312bb908-8d77-42a4-acf8-164961ccd34f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383915.534518, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "# Let's search for effective prompts for Midjourney.\nsearch(\"effective prompts for Midjourney AI\")"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "aaa281b3-8848-42a6-a9ab-a5651ae1ca9e", "children": ["a3cfc5a9-44aa-4edf-92ed-345e5323cf45"]}, "a3cfc5a9-44aa-4edf-92ed-345e5323cf45": {"id": "a3cfc5a9-44aa-4edf-92ed-345e5323cf45", "message": {"id": "a3cfc5a9-44aa-4edf-92ed-345e5323cf45", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383915.534825, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_browsing_display", "result": "# \u30100\u202025 Best Midjourney Prompts: Visual Guide - by Daniel Nest\u2020www.whytryai.com\u3011\nBest Midjourney prompts: February 2023 Originally shared in February 2023. 11. \u201c [Subject 1], [subject 2], double exposure\u201d Double exposure is a method that layers two images over one another at different exposure levels and with less than full opacity, so you can see both at the same time.\n# \u30101\u2020All-In-One Guide For Midjourney: The Art Of Prompts\u2020bowwe.com\u3011\nThe ultimate guide for pro prompts building for Midjourney 1.

Google goes AI-ll-in\n\nReturning \u30105\u2020from the dead\u2020io.google\u3011, Google went all-AI in its \u30105\u2020I/O 2023 Developer conference\u2020io.google\u3011.\n\nJust a few quick highlights *deep breath*:\n\n  * New, \u30106\u2020more powerful PaLM 2 LLM\u2020blog.google\u3011 coming to Bard \n\n  * Bard \u30107\u2020is now available in 180+ countries without a waitlist\u2020blog.google\u3011 and should soon get multimodal features like image recognition\n\n  * \u30108\u2020Duet AI\u2020workspace.google.com\u3011 brings AI-powered productivity to Gmail and Google Workspace (Sheets, Docs, and Slides)\n\n  * AI-driven immersive routes in \u30109\u2020Google Maps\u2020blog.google\u3011\n\n  * AI-powered \u301010\u2020Magic Editor\u2020blog.google\u3011 in Google Photos \n\n  * Their MusicLM text-to-video model, \u301011\u2020which I covered earlier in February\u3011, is \u301012\u2020now public\u2020aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com\u3011! (There is a waitlist though.)\n\n### 2. MosaicML\u2019s new open-source LLM\n\nSeriously, the parade of new LLMs just won\u2019t stop lately.\n\nMosaicML just unveiled \u301013\u2020an open-source model licensed for commercial use\u2020www.mosaicml.com\u3011. \n\nIt\u2019s even got a catchy name: MPT-7B. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nWhat sets MPT-7B apart is its ability to handle extremely long input of up to 84K tokens. (Anthropic recently \u301014\u2020bumped Claude to 100K\u2020www.anthropic.com\u3011 but you need to request access.)\n\nThere are three sub-models with different purposes, which you can check out for yourself right away:\n\n  * MPT-7B-StoryWriter-65k+: Read/write ultra-long stories (\u301015\u2020Demo\u2020huggingface.co\u3011)\n\n  * MPT-7B-Instruct: Follow short-form instructions (\u301016\u2020Demo\u2020huggingface.co\u3011)\n\n  * MPT-7B-Chat: Classic chatbot interface for dialogue (\u301017\u2020Demo\u2020huggingface.co\u3011)\n\n### 3. Stability AI enters the animation game\n\nPeople have been \u301018\u2020animating with Stable Diffusion\u3011 for a while.\n\nBut now Stability AI has released an official \u301019\u2020Stable Animation SDK\u2020stability.ai\u3011 tool for designers and artists, giving them three ways to create animations:\n\n  * Pure text input \n\n  * Image + text input \n\n  * Video input (similar to \u301020\u2020Runway Gen-1\u3011)\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find any free public demo at this point, so you\u2019ll have to \u301021\u2020learn a bit of Python to try it for yourself\u2020platform.stability.ai\u3011.\n\n### 4. Meta AI takes multimodality to the next level\n\nWhen OpenAI \u301022\u2020demoed multimodality in GPT-4\u3011, it was all about understanding images.\n\nMeta AI said \u201cHold my beer,\u201d and went for a whole six modalities with \u301023\u2020its new ImageBind model\u2020ai.facebook.com\u3011:\n\n  * Text \n\n  * Audio \n\n  * Image/video \n\n  * Thermal \n\n  * Motion and position (or I nertial M easurement U nits, if you\u2019re feeling fancy)\n\n  * Depth \n\nImageBind can collate input from all of the above to understand the world and generate various types of output:\n\n[Image: ImageBind cross-modal retrival, embedding-space arithmetic, audio to image generation]\n\nHere\u2019s a \u301024\u2020limited public demo\u2020imagebind.metademolab.com\u3011 with a few preset examples, so you can see what all the fuss is about.\n\nWhy Try AI is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0fAI tools\n\nThis week\u2019s selection of beginner-friendly AI tools. In \u301025\u2020last week\u2019s poll\u3011, most of you asked for productivity tools. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ll focus on today:\n\n### 5. Opus Clip\n\nWant to give a YouTube video some social media love or just highlight its most valuable parts?\n\n\u301026\u2020Opus Clip\u2020www.opus.pro\u3011 puts this task on autopilot. It takes a long video, automatically chunks it down to 10 shorter clips, captions them, and creates headline suggestions.\n\nIt even gives each resulting clip a predicted \u201cAI Virality Score\u201d based on past performance of similar clips. There\u2019s more AI-magic under the hood that can track a speaker\u2019s face, highlight impactful keywords in captions, and generate relevant emojis.\n\nAll it takes is literally a single click. You simply drop the YouTube URL into the relevant field and press the \u201cGet Clips For Free\u201d button.\n\nHere\u2019s a not-the-most-inspired-but-visual demo:\n\nOpus Clip is currently free and will still have a \u201cFree Forever\u201d plan when they launch paid options soon.\n\n\u301026\u2020Check out Opus Clip\u2020www.opus.pro\u3011\n\n### 6. Guidde\n\nNeed to make a visual \u201cHow to\u201d walkthrough of website features, processes, and so on?\n\n\u301027\u2020Guidde \u2020www.guidde.com\u3011is a stupid simple way to do that. \n\nIt\u2019s a browser extension that gives you a big red \u201cCapture\u201d button:\n\n[Image: Guidde \"Capture\" button]\n\nThen you fill in a few quick details about what you\u2019re capturing:\n\n[Image: Guidde capture description]\n\nYou\u2019re all set! \n\nAfter clicking \u201cGO,\u201d every new click you make in the active tab will be automatically registered. Once you\u2019re done, Guidde will create illustrated visuals of each step with accompanying text. \n\nYou\u2019ll then get a slide deck and a video that you can export in multiple ways. \n\nHere\u2019s a silent GIF of the complex process of commenting on this site:\n\n[Image: GIF from Guidde showing how to leave comments on Why Try AI]\n\nAnd here\u2019s a narrated version using \u301028\u2020stilted AI voiceover\u2020app.guidde.com\u3011. \n\nDon\u2019t worry, you can record your own voiceover or maybe use one of the more natural-sounding AI voices. (If you need inspiration, \u301029\u2020this roundup article\u2020www.ignorance.ai\u3011 by \n\n\u301030\u2020Artificial Ignorance\u2020open.substack.com\u3011\n\nis a great place to start.)\n\nYou can also edit any generated text or visual elements, but the whole point is that you mostly won\u2019t have to!\n\n\u301027\u2020Check out Guidde\u2020www.guidde.com\u3011\n\n### 7. Style AI\n\nThere\u2019s been a whole slew of AI website builders released lately. \n\n\u301031\u2020Style AI\u2020usestyle.ai\u3011 reduces the entire process to a few quick exchanges with an AI chatbot:\n\n[Image: Style AI input chat]\n\nYou answer several straightforward questions about whether the site is for business or personal use, the topics you\u2019d like covered, and the types of imagery and theme you want. Then, voila:\n\n[Image: Front page generated by Style AI]\n\nYou get a ready-made site with text, sections, and images put together entirely by AI. You can customize it yourself or continue asking the bot to make changes for you:\n\n[Image: Asking bot for changes in Style AI]\n\nIf you\u2019ve never set up websites before, Style AI is a foolproof way to dive in.\n\n\u301031\u2020Check out Style AI\u2020usestyle.ai\u3011\n\n### 8. Spoke\n\nIf you\u2019re okay with an AI tool recording your meetings, you can get a lot out of \u301032\u2020Spoke\u2020spoke.app\u3011.\n\n[Image: Spoke AI assistant front page]\n\nSpoke joins your meetings as a participant.\n\n[Image: Spoke asking to join a Google Meet]\n\nIt then records the entire meeting (or only parts of it, if you so choose) and generates a transcript. Here\u2019s a sad and lonely call I had with Spoke all by myself:\n\n[Image: Google Meet meeting transcript by Spoke]\n\nSpoke then picks the most appropriate summary template depending on the context and populates it with relevant parts of the meeting:\n\n[Image: Action points from a meeting, summarized by Spoke]\n\nClicking on highlighted action items and meeting summary notes takes you to the relevant parts of the video.

Just rolls off the tongue, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nWhat sets MPT-7B apart is its ability to handle extremely long input of up to 84K tokens. (Anthropic recently bumped Claude to 100K but you need to request access.)\n\nThere are three sub-models with different purposes, which you can check out for yourself right away:\n\n  * MPT-7B-StoryWriter-65k+: Read/write ultra-long stories (Demo)\n\n  * MPT-7B-Instruct: Follow short-form instructions (Demo)\n\n  * MPT-7B-Chat: Classic chatbot interface for dialogue (Demo)\n\n### 3. Stability AI enters the animation game\n\nPeople have been animating with Stable Diffusion for a while.\n\nBut now Stability AI has released an official Stable Animation SDK tool for designers and artists, giving them three ways to create animations:\n\n  * Pure text input \n\n  * Image + text input \n\n  * Video input (similar to Runway Gen-1)\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find any free public demo at this point, so you\u2019ll have to learn a bit of Python to try it for yourself.\n\n### 4. Meta AI takes multimodality to the next level\n\nWhen OpenAI demoed multimodality in GPT-4, it was all about understanding images.\n\nMeta AI said \u201cHold my beer,\u201d and went for a whole six modalities with its new ImageBind model:\n\n  * Text \n\n  * Audio \n\n  * Image/video \n\n  * Thermal \n\n  * Motion and position (or I nertial M easurement U nits, if you\u2019re feeling fancy)\n\n  * Depth \n\nImageBind can collate input from all of the above to understand the world and generate various types of output:\n\n[Image: ImageBind cross-modal retrival, embedding-space arithmetic, audio to image generation]\n\nHere\u2019s a limited public demo with a few preset examples, so you can see what all the fuss is about.\n\nWhy Try AI is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0fAI tools\n\nThis week\u2019s selection of beginner-friendly AI tools. In last week\u2019s poll, most of you asked for productivity tools. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ll focus on today:\n\n### 5. Opus Clip\n\nWant to give a YouTube video some social media love or just highlight its most valuable parts?\n\nOpus Clip puts this task on autopilot. It takes a long video, automatically chunks it down to 10 shorter clips, captions them, and creates headline suggestions.\n\nIt even gives each resulting clip a predicted \u201cAI Virality Score\u201d based on past performance of similar clips. There\u2019s more AI-magic under the hood that can track a speaker\u2019s face, highlight impactful keywords in captions, and generate relevant emojis.\n\nAll it takes is literally a single click. You simply drop the YouTube URL into the relevant field and press the \u201cGet Clips For Free\u201d button.\n\nHere\u2019s a not-the-most-inspired-but-visual demo:\n\nOpus Clip is currently free and will still have a \u201cFree Forever\u201d plan when they launch paid options soon.\n\nCheck out Opus Clip\n\n### 6. Guidde\n\nNeed to make a visual \u201cHow to\u201d walkthrough of website features, processes, and so on?\n\nGuidde is a stupid simple way to do that. \n\nIt\u2019s a browser extension that gives you a big red \u201cCapture\u201d button:\n\n[Image: Guidde \"Capture\" button]\n\nThen you fill in a few quick details about what you\u2019re capturing:\n\n[Image: Guidde capture description]\n\nYou\u2019re all set! \n\nAfter clicking \u201cGO,\u201d every new click you make in the active tab will be automatically registered. Once you\u2019re done, Guidde will create illustrated visuals of each step with accompanying text. \n\nYou\u2019ll then get a slide deck and a video that you can export in multiple ways. \n\nHere\u2019s a silent GIF of the complex process of commenting on this site:\n\n[Image: GIF from Guidde showing how to leave comments on Why Try AI]\n\nAnd here\u2019s a narrated version using stilted AI voiceover. \n\nDon\u2019t worry, you can record your own voiceover or maybe use one of the more natural-sounding AI voices. (If you need inspiration, this roundup article by \n\nArtificial Ignorance\n\nis a great place to start.)\n\nYou can also edit any generated text or visual elements, but the whole point is that you mostly won\u2019t have to!\n\nCheck out Guidde\n\n### 7. Style AI\n\nThere\u2019s been a whole slew of AI website builders released lately. \n\nStyle AI reduces the entire process to a few quick exchanges with an AI chatbot:\n\n[Image: Style AI input chat]\n\nYou answer several straightforward questions about whether the site is for business or personal use, the topics you\u2019d like covered, and the types of imagery and theme you want. Then, voila:\n\n[Image: Front page generated by Style AI]\n\nYou get a ready-made site with text, sections, and images put together entirely by AI. You can customize it yourself or continue asking the bot to make changes for you:\n\n[Image: Asking bot for changes in Style AI]\n\nIf you\u2019ve never set up websites before, Style AI is a foolproof way to dive in.\n\nCheck out Style AI\n\n### 8. Spoke\n\nIf you\u2019re okay with an AI tool recording your meetings, you can get a lot out of Spoke.\n\n[Image: Spoke AI assistant front page]\n\nSpoke joins your meetings as a participant.\n\n[Image: Spoke asking to join a Google Meet]\n\nIt then records the entire meeting (or only parts of it, if you so choose) and generates a transcript. Here\u2019s a sad and lonely call I had with Spoke all by myself:\n\n[Image: Google Meet meeting transcript by Spoke]\n\nSpoke then picks the most appropriate summary template depending on the context and populates it with relevant parts of the meeting:\n\n[Image: Action points from a meeting, summarized by Spoke]\n\nClicking on highlighted action items and meeting summary notes takes you to the relevant parts of the video. It\u2019s really handy to keep track of discussions, actions\nVisible: 0% - 76%", "pub_date": "2023-05-14"}], "original_query": null}, "command": "click", "args": [5], "status": "finished", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "62a4c8fe-96b3-45e7-aeb6-87763e81031e", "children": ["2076dd1e-554a-4b93-a88f-b43bd8a882d1"]}, "2076dd1e-554a-4b93-a88f-b43bd8a882d1": {"id": "2076dd1e-554a-4b93-a88f-b43bd8a882d1", "message": {"id": "2076dd1e-554a-4b93-a88f-b43bd8a882d1", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383915.537127, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "quote(\"Midjourney Subscription Plans\\n\\nIndividual \u2013\", \"the use of images.\")"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "2079db3c-654e-4e13-85cb-fd8ae2cf3060", "children": ["5a36af19-a7ea-4336-91ef-bf75b771ac10"]}, "5a36af19-a7ea-4336-91ef-bf75b771ac10": {"id": "5a36af19-a7ea-4336-91ef-bf75b771ac10", "message": {"id": "5a36af19-a7ea-4336-91ef-bf75b771ac10", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383915.537329, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "system_error", "name": "tool_error", "text": "Error when executing command `quote('Midjourney Subscription Plans\\n\\nIndividual \u2013', 'the use of images.')`\nquote failed\nThe provided passage needs to occur exactly in the open document, but it does not.

This makes the popular practice of \u201c\u30107\u2020splatterprompting\u3011\u201d from the early days of text-to-image art completely unnecessary.\n\nEvery month, I share five new Midjourney prompt ideas. So the list below is constantly growing.

Try to experiment!\n\nEDIT (March 19, 2023): \u30108\u2020Midjourney V5\u3011 is out. Sample images generated after this date are using Version 5. The rest are V4.\n\n## Best Midjourney prompts: December 2022\n\nSample images are Midjourney Version 4.\n\n### 1. \u201cExploded [subject] by Nychos\u201d\n\n\u30109\u2020Nychos\u2020nychos.com\u3011 is an illustrator and urban artist known for visually striking cross-section and X-ray images, often with gory details. Using the word \u201cexploded\u201d adds a sense of motion.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.][Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.][Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.]\n\nExploded guitar / banana / planet by Nychos.\n\n### 2. \u201c[Subject] as [subject]\u201d\n\nThis prompt asks Midjourney to imagine how things or characters would look like if they were something else. Really fun to experiment with.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.][Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.][Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.]\n\nHarry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.\n\n### 3. \u201c[Intangible subject or concept]\u201d\n\nMidjourney can try to draw intangibles like general concepts, emotions, or character traits. Exactly what you get depends on how the model interprets the word. Give it a shot!\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety. Joy. Wisdom.][Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety. Joy. Wisdom.][Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety. Joy. Wisdom.]\n\nAnxiety. Joy. Wisdom.\n\n### 4. \u201c[Subject], symmetrical, flat icon design\u201d\n\nThis prompt generates a flat, square icon based on your subject. You can use it for your website, app, or just have fun transforming random stuff into slick icons.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt: Cute alien face / Hulk / pizza, symmetrical, flat icon design.][Image: MJ prompt: Cute alien face / Hulk / pizza, symmetrical, flat icon design.][Image: MJ prompt: Cute alien face / Hulk / pizza, symmetrical, flat icon design.]\n\nCute alien face / Hulk / pizza, symmetrical, flat icon design.\n\n### 5. \u201c[Any emoji or combination of emojis]\u201d\n\nMidjourney is surprisingly good at interpreting emojis, especially obvious things like plants, animals, or objects. Combining multiple emojis in different ways generates awesome, often unexpected images.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ emoji prompts in radom combinations][Image: MJ emoji prompts in radom combinations][Image: MJ emoji prompts in radom combinations]\n\n\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udc7d / \u270d\ufe0f\ud83d\udcbc / \ud83d\ude95\ud83c\udf08\n\n\u301010\u2020Read the full post (December 2022)\u3011\n\nSubscribe to get new posts from \u201cWhy Try AI?\u201d (Check \u201cPromotions\u201d tab and \u201cSpam\u201d folder)\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Best Midjourney prompts: January 2023\n\nSample images are Midjourney Version 4.\n\n### 6. \u201cKnolling [subject or scene]\u201d\n\n\u201c\u301011\u2020Knolling\u2020www.amst.com\u3011\u201d is a photography term for overhead shots of items on a flat surface, placed in parallel to each other or at 90-degree angles. Midjourney\u2019s really good at mimicking and applying the \u201cknolling\u201d style to any concept.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt results Knolling: Solar system | Landscape | Fire Department][Image: MJ prompt results Knolling: Solar system | Landscape | Fire Department][Image: MJ prompt results Knolling: Solar system | Landscape | Fire Department]\n\nKnolling solar system / landscape | fire department \n\n### 7. \u201c16-bit [subject or scene]\u201d\n\nNostalgic for 1990s point-and-click adventures and other PC games of the era? You\u2019ll enjoy this one! It basically makes everything look as if it was made for a \u301012\u202016-bit graphics card\u2020www.computerhope.com\u3011.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt example: 16-bit sunset over a city / Mona Lisa / hot air balloons at night][Image: MJ prompt example: 16-bit sunset over a city / Mona Lisa / hot air balloons at night][Image: MJ prompt example: 16-bit sunset over a city / Mona Lisa / hot air balloons at night]\n\n16-bit sunset over a city / Mona Lisa / hot air balloons at night \n\n### 8. \u201c[Subject or scene] made out of [material]\u201d\n\nThis is great for making anything look as if it\u2019s made out of, well, also anything. Experiment making objects out of whatever you can imagine. See what kind of crazy stuff you can come up with.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: Eiffel Tower out of silly string | Car out of potatoes | Tree out of plastic bottles][Image: Eiffel Tower out of silly string | Car out of potatoes | Tree out of plastic bottles][Image: Eiffel Tower out of silly string | Car out of potatoes | Tree out of plastic bottles]\n\nEiffel Tower out of silly string / Car out of potatoes / Tree out of plastic bottles \n\n### 9. \u201cLayered paper [subject or scene]\u201d\n\nPerfect for getting a traditional \u201carts and crafts\u201d look. Midjourney tries to replicate the process of placing different paper shapes on top of each other to create a sort of 3D \u201clayered\u201d look.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: Layered paper: \"The Starry Night\" | Rainbow over a meadow | Star Wars spaceship battle][Image: Layered paper: \"The Starry Night\" | Rainbow over a meadow | Star Wars spaceship battle][Image: Layered paper: \"The Starry Night\" | Rainbow over a meadow | Star Wars spaceship battle]\n\nLayered paper \"The Starry Night\" / Rainbow over a meadow / Star Wars spaceship battle \n\n### 10. \u201cIsometric [subject or scene]\u201d\n\n\u301013\u2020Isometric art\u2020www.adobe.com\u3011 is all about making 2D illustrations appear like 3D objects. You\u2019ve undoubtedly seen the instantly recognizable 3D look in many city builders and other computer games. Midjourney lets you turn any scene or object into one of those. It\u2019s magic.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: Isometric: Submarine | Futuristic city | Hedgehog][Image: Isometric: Submarine | Futuristic city | Hedgehog][Image: Isometric: Submarine | Futuristic city | Hedgehog]\n\nIsometric submarine / futuristic city / hedgehog\n\n\u301014\u2020Read the full post (January 2023)\u3011\n\nSubscribe to get new posts from \u201cWhy Try AI?\u201d (Check \u201cPromotions\u201d tab and \u201cSpam\u201d folder)\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Best Midjourney prompts: February 2023\n\nSample images are Midjourney Version 4.\n\n### 11. \u201c[Subject 1], [subject 2], double exposure\u201d\n\n\u301015\u2020Double exposure\u2020www.studiobinder.com\u3011 is a method that layers two images over one another at different exposure levels and with less than full opacity, so you can see both at the same time. In Midjourney, this works best for portrait + scene combos.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: Cowboy + valley | Woman + forest | Pirate + ocean - MJ double exposure prompt][Image: Cowboy + valley | Woman + forest | Pirate + ocean - MJ double exposure prompt][Image: Cowboy + valley | Woman + forest | Pirate + ocean - MJ double exposure prompt]\n\nCowboy + valley / woman + forest / pirate + ocean double exposure \n\n### 12. \u201cBlacklight [subject or\nVisible: 0% - 49%", "summary": "www.whytryai.com (www.whytryai.com)\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"title": "www.whytryai.com", "url": "https://www.whytryai.com/p/best-midjourney-prompts", "text": "\nURL: https://www.whytryai.com/p/best-midjourney-prompts\nPublication Date: 2023-02-13\n\n\n[Image]\n\n# Why Try AI\n\nSubscribe Sign in\n\nHome\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 Best Midjourney Prompts\n\n10X AI\n\nAbout\n\nShare this post\n\n[Image]\n\n#### 25 Best Midjourney Prompts: Visual Guide \n\nwww.whytryai.com \n\nCopy link \n\nTwitter \n\nFacebook \n\nEmail \n\nNotes \n\n# 25 Best Midjourney Prompts: Visual Guide\n\n[Image]\n\nDaniel Nest\n\nFeb 13, 2023 \n\n9\n\n7\n\nShare \n\nShare this post\n\n[Image]\n\n#### 25 Best Midjourney Prompts: Visual Guide \n\nwww.whytryai.com \n\nCopy link \n\nTwitter \n\nFacebook \n\nEmail \n\nNotes \n\nSome of the best Midjourney prompts need just a single style modifier.\n\nMidjourney creates sharp, detailed, and coherent images even with very simple prompts.

Try to experiment!\n\nEDIT (March 19, 2023): Midjourney V5 is out. Sample images generated after this date are using Version 5. The rest are V4.\n\n## Best Midjourney prompts: December 2022\n\nSample images are Midjourney Version 4.\n\n### 1. \u201cExploded [subject] by Nychos\u201d\n\nNychos is an illustrator and urban artist known for visually striking cross-section and X-ray images, often with gory details. Using the word \u201cexploded\u201d adds a sense of motion.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.][Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.][Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.]\n\nExploded guitar / banana / planet by Nychos.\n\n### 2. \u201c[Subject] as [subject]\u201d\n\nThis prompt asks Midjourney to imagine how things or characters would look like if they were something else. Really fun to experiment with.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.][Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.][Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.]\n\nHarry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.\n\n### 3. \u201c[Intangible subject or concept]\u201d\n\nMidjourney can try to draw intangibles like general concepts, emotions, or character traits. Exactly what you get depends on how the model interprets the word. Give it a shot!\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety. Joy. Wisdom.][Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety. Joy. Wisdom.][Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety. Joy. Wisdom.]\n\nAnxiety. Joy. Wisdom.\n\n### 4. \u201c[Subject], symmetrical, flat icon design\u201d\n\nThis prompt generates a flat, square icon based on your subject. You can use it for your website, app, or just have fun transforming random stuff into slick icons.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt: Cute alien face / Hulk / pizza, symmetrical, flat icon design.][Image: MJ prompt: Cute alien face / Hulk / pizza, symmetrical, flat icon design.][Image: MJ prompt: Cute alien face / Hulk / pizza, symmetrical, flat icon design.]\n\nCute alien face / Hulk / pizza, symmetrical, flat icon design.\n\n### 5. \u201c[Any emoji or combination of emojis]\u201d\n\nMidjourney is surprisingly good at interpreting emojis, especially obvious things like plants, animals, or objects. Combining multiple emojis in different ways generates awesome, often unexpected images.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ emoji prompts in radom combinations][Image: MJ emoji prompts in radom combinations][Image: MJ emoji prompts in radom combinations]\n\n\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udc7d / \u270d\ufe0f\ud83d\udcbc / \ud83d\ude95\ud83c\udf08\n\nRead the full post (December 2022)\n\nSubscribe to get new posts from \u201cWhy Try AI?\u201d (Check \u201cPromotions\u201d tab and \u201cSpam\u201d folder)\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Best Midjourney prompts: January 2023\n\nSample images are Midjourney Version 4.\n\n### 6. \u201cKnolling [subject or scene]\u201d\n\n\u201cKnolling\u201d is a photography term for overhead shots of items on a flat surface, placed in parallel to each other or at 90-degree angles. Midjourney\u2019s really good at mimicking and applying the \u201cknolling\u201d style to any concept.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt results Knolling: Solar system | Landscape | Fire Department][Image: MJ prompt results Knolling: Solar system | Landscape | Fire Department][Image: MJ prompt results Knolling: Solar system | Landscape | Fire Department]\n\nKnolling solar system / landscape | fire department \n\n### 7. \u201c16-bit [subject or scene]\u201d\n\nNostalgic for 1990s point-and-click adventures and other PC games of the era? You\u2019ll enjoy this one! It basically makes everything look as if it was made for a 16-bit graphics card.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt example: 16-bit sunset over a city / Mona Lisa / hot air balloons at night][Image: MJ prompt example: 16-bit sunset over a city / Mona Lisa / hot air balloons at night][Image: MJ prompt example: 16-bit sunset over a city / Mona Lisa / hot air balloons at night]\n\n16-bit sunset over a city / Mona Lisa / hot air balloons at night \n\n### 8. \u201c[Subject or scene] made out of [material]\u201d\n\nThis is great for making anything look as if it\u2019s made out of, well, also anything. Experiment making objects out of whatever you can imagine. See what kind of crazy stuff you can come up with.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: Eiffel Tower out of silly string | Car out of potatoes | Tree out of plastic bottles][Image: Eiffel Tower out of silly string | Car out of potatoes | Tree out of plastic bottles][Image: Eiffel Tower out of silly string | Car out of potatoes | Tree out of plastic bottles]\n\nEiffel Tower out of silly string / Car out of potatoes / Tree out of plastic bottles \n\n### 9. \u201cLayered paper [subject or scene]\u201d\n\nPerfect for getting a traditional \u201carts and crafts\u201d look. Midjourney tries to replicate the process of placing different paper shapes on top of each other to create a sort of 3D \u201clayered\u201d look.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: Layered paper: \"The Starry Night\" | Rainbow over a meadow | Star Wars spaceship battle][Image: Layered paper: \"The Starry Night\" | Rainbow over a meadow | Star Wars spaceship battle][Image: Layered paper: \"The Starry Night\" | Rainbow over a meadow | Star Wars spaceship battle]\n\nLayered paper \"The Starry Night\" / Rainbow over a meadow / Star Wars spaceship battle \n\n### 10. \u201cIsometric [subject or scene]\u201d\n\nIsometric art is all about making 2D illustrations appear like 3D objects. You\u2019ve undoubtedly seen the instantly recognizable 3D look in many city builders and other computer games. Midjourney lets you turn any scene or object into one of those. It\u2019s magic.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: Isometric: Submarine | Futuristic city | Hedgehog][Image: Isometric: Submarine | Futuristic city | Hedgehog][Image: Isometric: Submarine | Futuristic city | Hedgehog]\n\nIsometric submarine / futuristic city / hedgehog\n\nRead the full post (January 2023)\n\nSubscribe to get new posts from \u201cWhy Try AI?\u201d (Check \u201cPromotions\u201d tab and \u201cSpam\u201d folder)\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Best Midjourney prompts: February 2023\n\nSample images are Midjourney Version 4.\n\n### 11. \u201c[Subject 1], [subject 2], double exposure\u201d\n\nDouble exposure is a method that layers two images over one another at different exposure levels and with less than full opacity, so you can see both at the same time. In Midjourney, this works best for portrait + scene combos.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: Cowboy + valley | Woman + forest | Pirate + ocean - MJ double exposure prompt][Image: Cowboy + valley | Woman + forest | Pirate + ocean - MJ double exposure prompt][Image: Cowboy + valley | Woman + forest | Pirate + ocean - MJ double exposure prompt]\n\nCowboy + valley / woman + forest / pirate + ocean double exposure \n\n### 12. \u201cBlacklight [subject or\nVisible: 0% - 49%", "pub_date": "2023-02-13"}], "original_query": null}, "command": "click", "args": [2], "status": "finished", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "032d0362-0475-4872-9ae1-e095ad391cca", "children": ["5624b910-a15f-40df-a455-9489bfef7f45"]}, "5624b910-a15f-40df-a455-9489bfef7f45": {"id": "5624b910-a15f-40df-a455-9489bfef7f45", "message": {"id": "5624b910-a15f-40df-a455-9489bfef7f45", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383915.539909, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "quote(\"Midjourney is a subscription-based service,\", \"giving you 50 minutes of generation time.\")"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "03ea79d7-f0ea-4959-b445-fc08c93b8fe2", "children": ["0d90d3c4-56b8-4b36-9bb5-86e38798b873"]}, "0d90d3c4-56b8-4b36-9bb5-86e38798b873": {"id": "0d90d3c4-56b8-4b36-9bb5-86e38798b873", "message": {"id": "0d90d3c4-56b8-4b36-9bb5-86e38798b873", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684383915.540139, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "system_error", "name": "tool_error", "text": "Error when executing command `quote('Midjourney is a subscription-based service,', 'giving you 50 minutes of generation time.')`\nquote failed\nThe provided passage needs to occur exactly in the open document, but it does not.

Midjourney runs entirely from a Discord server, so the first thing you need is a Discord account. Once you're on Discord, you'll need to join the Midjourney server\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n2. To generate images, you \"chat\" with the Midjourney bot. All messages for generating images start with `/imagine prompt`. For example, to generate an image of an astronaut on a horse, you would send `/imagine prompt astronaut on a horse` to the bot\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n3. Once you're in, you'll see a long list of channels. As a newcomer, you'll want to head for one of the Newcomer Rooms, where you can see other members making prompts and the resulting images. This will give you a first glimpse of the platform and let you become familiar with the tool\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n4. Midjourney always generates four images from the prompts. You then have three options:\n    - Redo the whole process to get a new set\n    - Upscale one of the four pictures\n    - Use one of the four as a starting template for another run\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n5. There used to be a free trial for new users to experiment with Midjourney, but due to immense demand, it was removed. As a result, you'll need a subscription plan to access everything. Occasionally, a free trial is offered, most notably when a new AI model is released, but it's relatively infrequent\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n6. The AI image generator supports a number of commands and parameters to adjust what and how it manages the process, most of which you add after the descriptive text. By default, Midjourney will use the latest public model (version 5.1) and create 512 x 512 pictures\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n7. The differences between the various models lie mainly in how effectively they interpret the prompt and how accurately the generated image corresponds to the input text. The more recent Midjourney versions (4, 5, and 5.1) all have very high coherency, with version 4 being strong with image-based prompts and versions 5 and 5.1 being extremely good at handling natural text prompts\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n8. The tool offers various parameters that can be used to adjust the image output, such as:\n    - `--version` or `--v` to change which deep learning model gets used.\n    - `--style` to tweak model version 4.\n    - `--niji`, another model that's been trained on lots of anime illustrations and art.\n    - `--aspect` or `--ar` to change the ratio of width to height of the images.\n    - `--chaos` to alter how 'creative' the images will be.\n    - `--stylize` or `--s` to adjust how closely the generator sticks to the prompt.\n    - `--quality` or `--q` to control how much GPU processing time is allocated to making the image\u301015\u2020source\u3011\u301016\u2020source\u3011.\n9. Midjourney can also use images, instead of text, to create new pieces of art. Instead of typing `/imagine`, you use `/blend` and then upload up to 5 pictures from your storage drive into Discord\u301017\u2020source\u3011.\n\nI hope this information helps!

That means you can use Midjourney on most devices running Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, or Android.\n\nOnce you are on Discord, join the Midjourney server.\n\nEssentially, what you're going to do is \"chat\" with the Midjourney bot.

The example you can see below was created by sending: /imagine prompt astronaut on a horse to the bot.\n\n[Image]\n\nOnce you're in, you'll see a long list of channels, but for now head for one of the Newcomer Rooms.

We'll revisit the topic of subscriptions later, and for the remainder of this guide, we'll assume you have the most basic plan.\n\nMidjourney always generates 4 images from the prompts and gives you three options:\n\n  * Redo the whole process to get a new set (the blue double-arrow button)\n  * Upscale one of the four pictures (the U1, U2, U3, U4 buttons)\n  * Use one of the four as a starting template for another run (the V1, V2, V3, V4 buttons).\n\nIt takes a couple of minutes to compose images; however, depending on the server's workload, there might be a longer pause before you can receive your results. With so many people in the channels, your results will quickly scroll out of view, so be sure to keep an eye out for them.\n\n## Using commands and prompt parameters\n\nThe AI image generator supports a number of commands and parameters to adjust what and how it manages the process, most of which you add after the descriptive text. You don't need to use these, as by default, Midjourney will use the latest public model (version 5.1) and create 512 x 512 pictures (older models are 256 x 256).\n\nThe differences between the various models lie mainly in two aspects \u2013 how effectively they interpret the prompt and how accurately the generated image corresponds to the input text (a property known as coherency).\n\n[Image]\n\n\"Vibrant California poppies\" v4 (left) versus v5 (right).\n\nThe more recent Midjourney versions (4, 5, and 5.1) all have very high coherency, though version 4's strength is with image-based prompts; version 5 and 5.1 are extremely good at handling natural text prompts.\n\nVersion 3 has moderate coherency, and the others are all rated as low.

Google goes AI-ll-in\n\nReturning \u30105\u2020from the dead\u2020io.google\u3011, Google went all-AI in its \u30105\u2020I/O 2023 Developer conference\u2020io.google\u3011.\n\nJust a few quick highlights *deep breath*:\n\n  * New, \u30106\u2020more powerful PaLM 2 LLM\u2020blog.google\u3011 coming to Bard \n\n  * Bard \u30107\u2020is now available in 180+ countries without a waitlist\u2020blog.google\u3011 and should soon get multimodal features like image recognition\n\n  * \u30108\u2020Duet AI\u2020workspace.google.com\u3011 brings AI-powered productivity to Gmail and Google Workspace (Sheets, Docs, and Slides)\n\n  * AI-driven immersive routes in \u30109\u2020Google Maps\u2020blog.google\u3011\n\n  * AI-powered \u301010\u2020Magic Editor\u2020blog.google\u3011 in Google Photos \n\n  * Their MusicLM text-to-video model, \u301011\u2020which I covered earlier in February\u3011, is \u301012\u2020now public\u2020aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com\u3011! (There is a waitlist though.)\n\n### 2. MosaicML\u2019s new open-source LLM\n\nSeriously, the parade of new LLMs just won\u2019t stop lately.\n\nMosaicML just unveiled \u301013\u2020an open-source model licensed for commercial use\u2020www.mosaicml.com\u3011. \n\nIt\u2019s even got a catchy name: MPT-7B. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nWhat sets MPT-7B apart is its ability to handle extremely long input of up to 84K tokens. (Anthropic recently \u301014\u2020bumped Claude to 100K\u2020www.anthropic.com\u3011 but you need to request access.)\n\nThere are three sub-models with different purposes, which you can check out for yourself right away:\n\n  * MPT-7B-StoryWriter-65k+: Read/write ultra-long stories (\u301015\u2020Demo\u2020huggingface.co\u3011)\n\n  * MPT-7B-Instruct: Follow short-form instructions (\u301016\u2020Demo\u2020huggingface.co\u3011)\n\n  * MPT-7B-Chat: Classic chatbot interface for dialogue (\u301017\u2020Demo\u2020huggingface.co\u3011)\n\n### 3. Stability AI enters the animation game\n\nPeople have been \u301018\u2020animating with Stable Diffusion\u3011 for a while.\n\nBut now Stability AI has released an official \u301019\u2020Stable Animation SDK\u2020stability.ai\u3011 tool for designers and artists, giving them three ways to create animations:\n\n  * Pure text input \n\n  * Image + text input \n\n  * Video input (similar to \u301020\u2020Runway Gen-1\u3011)\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find any free public demo at this point, so you\u2019ll have to \u301021\u2020learn a bit of Python to try it for yourself\u2020platform.stability.ai\u3011.\n\n### 4. Meta AI takes multimodality to the next level\n\nWhen OpenAI \u301022\u2020demoed multimodality in GPT-4\u3011, it was all about understanding images.\n\nMeta AI said \u201cHold my beer,\u201d and went for a whole six modalities with \u301023\u2020its new ImageBind model\u2020ai.facebook.com\u3011:\n\n  * Text \n\n  * Audio \n\n  * Image/video \n\n  * Thermal \n\n  * Motion and position (or I nertial M easurement U nits, if you\u2019re feeling fancy)\n\n  * Depth \n\nImageBind can collate input from all of the above to understand the world and generate various types of output:\n\n[Image: ImageBind cross-modal retrival, embedding-space arithmetic, audio to image generation]\n\nHere\u2019s a \u301024\u2020limited public demo\u2020imagebind.metademolab.com\u3011 with a few preset examples, so you can see what all the fuss is about.\n\nWhy Try AI is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0fAI tools\n\nThis week\u2019s selection of beginner-friendly AI tools. In \u301025\u2020last week\u2019s poll\u3011, most of you asked for productivity tools. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ll focus on today:\n\n### 5. Opus Clip\n\nWant to give a YouTube video some social media love or just highlight its most valuable parts?\n\n\u301026\u2020Opus Clip\u2020www.opus.pro\u3011 puts this task on autopilot. It takes a long video, automatically chunks it down to 10 shorter clips, captions them, and creates headline suggestions.\n\nIt even gives each resulting clip a predicted \u201cAI Virality Score\u201d based on past performance of similar clips. There\u2019s more AI-magic under the hood that can track a speaker\u2019s face, highlight impactful keywords in captions, and generate relevant emojis.\n\nAll it takes is literally a single click. You simply drop the YouTube URL into the relevant field and press the \u201cGet Clips For Free\u201d button.\n\nHere\u2019s a not-the-most-inspired-but-visual demo:\n\nOpus Clip is currently free and will still have a \u201cFree Forever\u201d plan when they launch paid options soon.\n\n\u301026\u2020Check out Opus Clip\u2020www.opus.pro\u3011\n\n### 6. Guidde\n\nNeed to make a visual \u201cHow to\u201d walkthrough of website features, processes, and so on?\n\n\u301027\u2020Guidde \u2020www.guidde.com\u3011is a stupid simple way to do that. \n\nIt\u2019s a browser extension that gives you a big red \u201cCapture\u201d button:\n\n[Image: Guidde \"Capture\" button]\n\nThen you fill in a few quick details about what you\u2019re capturing:\n\n[Image: Guidde capture description]\n\nYou\u2019re all set! \n\nAfter clicking \u201cGO,\u201d every new click you make in the active tab will be automatically registered. Once you\u2019re done, Guidde will create illustrated visuals of each step with accompanying text. \n\nYou\u2019ll then get a slide deck and a video that you can export in multiple ways. \n\nHere\u2019s a silent GIF of the complex process of commenting on this site:\n\n[Image: GIF from Guidde showing how to leave comments on Why Try AI]\n\nAnd here\u2019s a narrated version using \u301028\u2020stilted AI voiceover\u2020app.guidde.com\u3011. \n\nDon\u2019t worry, you can record your own voiceover or maybe use one of the more natural-sounding AI voices. (If you need inspiration, \u301029\u2020this roundup article\u2020www.ignorance.ai\u3011 by \n\n\u301030\u2020Artificial Ignorance\u2020open.substack.com\u3011\n\nis a great place to start.)\n\nYou can also edit any generated text or visual elements, but the whole point is that you mostly won\u2019t have to!\n\n\u301027\u2020Check out Guidde\u2020www.guidde.com\u3011\n\n### 7. Style AI\n\nThere\u2019s been a whole slew of AI website builders released lately. \n\n\u301031\u2020Style AI\u2020usestyle.ai\u3011 reduces the entire process to a few quick exchanges with an AI chatbot:\n\n[Image: Style AI input chat]\n\nYou answer several straightforward questions about whether the site is for business or personal use, the topics you\u2019d like covered, and the types of imagery and theme you want. Then, voila:\n\n[Image: Front page generated by Style AI]\n\nYou get a ready-made site with text, sections, and images put together entirely by AI. You can customize it yourself or continue asking the bot to make changes for you:\n\n[Image: Asking bot for changes in Style AI]\n\nIf you\u2019ve never set up websites before, Style AI is a foolproof way to dive in.\n\n\u301031\u2020Check out Style AI\u2020usestyle.ai\u3011\n\n### 8.

Google goes AI-ll-in\n\nReturning from the dead, Google went all-AI in its I/O 2023 Developer conference.\n\nJust a few quick highlights *deep breath*:\n\n  * New, more powerful PaLM 2 LLM coming to Bard \n\n  * Bard is now available in 180+ countries without a waitlist and should soon get multimodal features like image recognition\n\n  * Duet AI brings AI-powered productivity to Gmail and Google Workspace (Sheets, Docs, and Slides)\n\n  * AI-driven immersive routes in Google Maps\n\n  * AI-powered Magic Editor in Google Photos \n\n  * Their MusicLM text-to-video model, which I covered earlier in February, is now public! (There is a waitlist though.)\n\n### 2. MosaicML\u2019s new open-source LLM\n\nSeriously, the parade of new LLMs just won\u2019t stop lately.\n\nMosaicML just unveiled an open-source model licensed for commercial use. \n\nIt\u2019s even got a catchy name: MPT-7B. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nWhat sets MPT-7B apart is its ability to handle extremely long input of up to 84K tokens. (Anthropic recently bumped Claude to 100K but you need to request access.)\n\nThere are three sub-models with different purposes, which you can check out for yourself right away:\n\n  * MPT-7B-StoryWriter-65k+: Read/write ultra-long stories (Demo)\n\n  * MPT-7B-Instruct: Follow short-form instructions (Demo)\n\n  * MPT-7B-Chat: Classic chatbot interface for dialogue (Demo)\n\n### 3. Stability AI enters the animation game\n\nPeople have been animating with Stable Diffusion for a while.\n\nBut now Stability AI has released an official Stable Animation SDK tool for designers and artists, giving them three ways to create animations:\n\n  * Pure text input \n\n  * Image + text input \n\n  * Video input (similar to Runway Gen-1)\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find any free public demo at this point, so you\u2019ll have to learn a bit of Python to try it for yourself.\n\n### 4. Meta AI takes multimodality to the next level\n\nWhen OpenAI demoed multimodality in GPT-4, it was all about understanding images.\n\nMeta AI said \u201cHold my beer,\u201d and went for a whole six modalities with its new ImageBind model:\n\n  * Text \n\n  * Audio \n\n  * Image/video \n\n  * Thermal \n\n  * Motion and position (or I nertial M easurement U nits, if you\u2019re feeling fancy)\n\n  * Depth \n\nImageBind can collate input from all of the above to understand the world and generate various types of output:\n\n[Image: ImageBind cross-modal retrival, embedding-space arithmetic, audio to image generation]\n\nHere\u2019s a limited public demo with a few preset examples, so you can see what all the fuss is about.\n\nWhy Try AI is a reader-supported publication.

In last week\u2019s poll, most of you asked for productivity tools. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ll focus on today:\n\n### 5. Opus Clip\n\nWant to give a YouTube video some social media love or just highlight its most valuable parts?\n\nOpus Clip puts this task on autopilot. It takes a long video, automatically chunks it down to 10 shorter clips, captions them, and creates headline suggestions.\n\nIt even gives each resulting clip a predicted \u201cAI Virality Score\u201d based on past performance of similar clips. There\u2019s more AI-magic under the hood that can track a speaker\u2019s face, highlight impactful keywords in captions, and generate relevant emojis.\n\nAll it takes is literally a single click. You simply drop the YouTube URL into the relevant field and press the \u201cGet Clips For Free\u201d button.\n\nHere\u2019s a not-the-most-inspired-but-visual demo:\n\nOpus Clip is currently free and will still have a \u201cFree Forever\u201d plan when they launch paid options soon.\n\nCheck out Opus Clip\n\n### 6. Guidde\n\nNeed to make a visual \u201cHow to\u201d walkthrough of website features, processes, and so on?\n\nGuidde is a stupid simple way to do that. \n\nIt\u2019s a browser extension that gives you a big red \u201cCapture\u201d button:\n\n[Image: Guidde \"Capture\" button]\n\nThen you fill in a few quick details about what you\u2019re capturing:\n\n[Image: Guidde capture description]\n\nYou\u2019re all set! \n\nAfter clicking \u201cGO,\u201d every new click you make in the active tab will be automatically registered. Once you\u2019re done, Guidde will create illustrated visuals of each step with accompanying text. \n\nYou\u2019ll then get a slide deck and a video that you can export in multiple ways. \n\nHere\u2019s a silent GIF of the complex process of commenting on this site:\n\n[Image: GIF from Guidde showing how to leave comments on Why Try AI]\n\nAnd here\u2019s a narrated version using stilted AI voiceover. \n\nDon\u2019t worry, you can record your own voiceover or maybe use one of the more natural-sounding AI voices. (If you need inspiration, this roundup article by \n\nArtificial Ignorance\n\nis a great place to start.)\n\nYou can also edit any generated text or visual elements, but the whole point is that you mostly won\u2019t have to!\n\nCheck out Guidde\n\n### 7. Style AI\n\nThere\u2019s been a whole slew of AI website builders released lately. \n\nStyle AI reduces the entire process to a few quick exchanges with an AI chatbot:\n\n[Image: Style AI input chat]\n\nYou answer several straightforward questions about whether the site is for business or personal use, the topics you\u2019d like covered, and the types of imagery and theme you want. Then, voila:\n\n[Image: Front page generated by Style AI]\n\nYou get a ready-made site with text, sections, and images put together entirely by AI. You can customize it yourself or continue asking the bot to make changes for you:\n\n[Image: Asking bot for changes in Style AI]\n\nIf you\u2019ve never set up websites before, Style AI is a foolproof way to dive in.\n\nCheck out Style AI\n\n### 8. Spoke\n\nIf you\u2019re okay with an AI tool recording your meetings, you can get a lot out of Spoke.\n\n[Image: Spoke AI assistant front page]\n\nSpoke joins your meetings as a participant.\n\n[Image: Spoke asking to join a Google Meet]\n\nIt then records the entire meeting (or only parts of it, if you so choose) and generates a transcript. Here\u2019s a sad and lonely call I had with Spoke all by myself:\n\n[Image: Google Meet meeting transcript by Spoke]\n\nSpoke then picks the most appropriate summary template depending on the context and populates it with relevant parts of the meeting:\n\n[Image: Action points from a meeting, summarized by Spoke]\n\nClicking on highlighted action items and meeting summary notes takes you to the relevant parts of the video.

This makes the popular practice of \u201c\u30107\u2020splatterprompting\u3011\u201d from the early days of text-to-image art completely unnecessary.\n\nEvery month, I share five new Midjourney prompt ideas. So the list below is constantly growing. Check back every now and then\u2026or subscribe to get weekly posts (including monthly Midjourney prompt examples) in your inbox:\n\nSubscribe to get new posts from \u201cWhy Try AI?\u201d (Check \u201cPromotions\u201d tab and \u201cSpam\u201d folder)\n\nSubscribe\n\nRemember that all of the individual prompt modifiers on this list can be combined in any number of ways to create a unique look. Try to experiment!\n\nEDIT (March 19, 2023): \u30108\u2020Midjourney V5\u3011 is out. Sample images generated after this date are using Version 5. The rest are V4.\n\n## Best Midjourney prompts: December 2022\n\nSample images are Midjourney Version 4.\n\n### 1. \u201cExploded [subject] by Nychos\u201d\n\n\u30109\u2020Nychos\u2020nychos.com\u3011 is an illustrator and urban artist known for visually striking cross-section and X-ray images, often with gory details. Using the word \u201cexploded\u201d adds a sense of motion.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.][Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.][Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.]\n\nExploded guitar / banana / planet by Nychos.\n\n### 2. \u201c[Subject] as [subject]\u201d\n\nThis prompt asks Midjourney to imagine how things or characters would look like if they were something else. Really fun to experiment with.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.][Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.][Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.]\n\nHarry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.\n\n### 3. \u201c[Intangible subject or concept]\u201d\n\nMidjourney can try to draw intangibles like general concepts, emotions, or character traits. Exactly what you get depends on how the model interprets the word. Give it a shot!\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety. Joy. Wisdom.][Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety.

This makes the popular practice of \u201csplatterprompting\u201d from the early days of text-to-image art completely unnecessary.\n\nEvery month, I share five new Midjourney prompt ideas. So the list below is constantly growing.

Try to experiment!\n\nEDIT (March 19, 2023): Midjourney V5 is out. Sample images generated after this date are using Version 5. The rest are V4.\n\n## Best Midjourney prompts: December 2022\n\nSample images are Midjourney Version 4.\n\n### 1. \u201cExploded [subject] by Nychos\u201d\n\nNychos is an illustrator and urban artist known for visually striking cross-section and X-ray images, often with gory details. Using the word \u201cexploded\u201d adds a sense of motion.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.][Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.][Image: MJ Prompt: Exploded guitar, banana, and planet.]\n\nExploded guitar / banana / planet by Nychos.\n\n### 2. \u201c[Subject] as [subject]\u201d\n\nThis prompt asks Midjourney to imagine how things or characters would look like if they were something else. Really fun to experiment with.\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.][Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain. Pac-Man as a giant monster. Thanos as a businessman.][Image: MJ prompt: Harry potter as a Marvel villain.

Thanos as a businessman.\n\n### 3. \u201c[Intangible subject or concept]\u201d\n\nMidjourney can try to draw intangibles like general concepts, emotions, or character traits. Exactly what you get depends on how the model interprets the word. Give it a shot!\n\nSample images:\n\n[Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety. Joy. Wisdom.][Image: MJ single-word prompts: Anxiety.

Traditionally needlepoint designs completely cover the canvas.\u301066\u2020[1]\u3011 Although needlepoint may be worked in a variety of stitches, many needlepoint designs use only a simple \u301067\u2020tent stitch\u3011 and rely upon color changes in the yarn to construct the pattern. Needlepoint is the oldest form of canvas work.\u301068\u2020[2]\u3011\n\nThe degree of detail in needlepoint depends on the \u301069\u2020thread count\u3011 of the underlying mesh fabric. Due to the inherent lack of suppleness of needlepoint, common uses include eyeglass cases, holiday ornaments, pillows, purses, upholstery, and wall hangings.\u301070\u2020[3]\u3011\n\n## History[\u301071\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nThe roots of needlepoint go back thousands of years to the ancient Egyptians, who used small slanted stitches to sew up their canvas tents. \u301072\u2020Howard Carter\u3011, of \u301073\u2020Tutankhamen\u3011 fame, found some needlepoint in the cave of a \u301074\u2020Pharaoh\u3011 who had lived around 1500 BC.\u301068\u2020[2]\u3011\n\nModern needlepoint descends from the canvas work in \u301067\u2020tent stitch\u3011, done on an evenly woven open ground fabric that was a popular domestic craft in the 16th century.\u301075\u2020[4]\u3011\n\nFurther development of needlepoint was influenced in the 17th century by \u301076\u2020Bargello\u3011\u301077\u2020[5]\u3011 and in the 19th century by shaded \u301078\u2020Berlin wool work\u3011 in brightly colored wool yarn. Upholstered furniture became fashionable in the 17th century, and this prompted the development of a more durable material to serve as a foundation for the embroidered works of art. In 18th century America, needlepoint was used as a preparatory skill to train young women to sew their own clothing.\u301079\u2020[6]\u3011\n\n## Terminology[\u301080\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * Differences between needlepoint and other types of embroidery\n  * [Image: Needlepoint is worked upon specialized types of stiff canvas that have openings at regular intervals.]\n\nNeedlepoint is worked upon specialized types of stiff canvas that have openings at regular intervals. \n\n  * [Image: Embroidery that is not needlepoint often uses soft cloth and requires an embroidery hoop.]\n\nEmbroidery that is not needlepoint often uses soft cloth and requires an \u301081\u2020embroidery hoop\u3011. \n\nWhen referring to handcrafted textile arts which a speaker is unable to identify, the appropriate generalized term is \"\u301082\u2020needlework\u3011\". The first recorded use of the term needlepoint is in 1869, as a synonym for point-lace.\u301083\u2020[7]\u3011 \u301084\u2020Mrs Beeton\u3011's Beeton's Book of Needlework (1870) does not use the term \"needlework\", but rather describes \"every kind of stitch which is made upon canvas with wool, silk or beads\" as \u301078\u2020Berlin Work\u3011 (also spelled Berlinwork). Berlin Work refers to a subset of needlepoint, popular in the mid-19th Century that was stitched in brightly colored wool on needlepoint canvas from hand-colored charts.\u301085\u2020[8]\u3011\n\n\"Needlepoint\" refers to a particular set of stitching techniques worked upon stiff openwork canvas.\u301086\u2020[9]\u3011\u301087\u2020[10]\u3011\u301088\u2020[11]\u3011 However, \"needlepoint\" is not synonymous with all types of embroidery. Because it is stitched on a fabric that is an open grid, needlepoint is not embellishing a fabric, as is the case with most other types of embroidery, but literally the making of a new fabric. It is for this reason that many needlepoint stitches must be of sturdier construction than other embroidery stitches. \n\nNeedlepoint is often referred to as \"tapestry\"\u301089\u2020[12]\u3011 in the United Kingdom and sometimes as \"canvas work\". However, needlepoint\u2014which is stitched on canvas mesh\u2014differs from true tapestry\u2014which is woven on a vertical loom. When worked on fine weave canvas in tent stitch, it is also known as \"petit point\". Additionally, \"needlepoint lace\" is also an older term for \u301090\u2020needle lace\u3011, an historic lace-making technique. \n\n## Contemporary techniques[\u301091\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n### Materials[\u301092\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nThe thread used for stitching may be \u301093\u2020wool\u3011, \u301094\u2020silk\u3011, \u301095\u2020cotton\u3011 or combinations, such as wool-silk blend. Variety fibers may also be used, such as metallic cord, metallic braid, \u301096\u2020ribbon\u3011, or \u301097\u2020raffia\u3011.

You can find the latest version on Docker's official download page: https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/. Choose the Docker version that you want to install.\n\n2. **Transfer the package to the offline server**: After downloading the Docker package, you'll need to transfer it to the offline server. You can use a method that suits your situation, such as SCP (Secure Copy), SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), or physically moving it with a USB drive.\n\n3. **Uninstall the old Docker version**: Before installing the new Docker version, you should remove the old version first. Use the following commands:\n\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl stop docker\n    sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc\n    ```\n\n    The above commands will stop Docker and remove Docker packages but won't remove images, containers, volumes, or user-created configuration files on your host. It is strongly recommended to back up your data before you proceed.\n\n4. **Install the new Docker version**: After transferring the Docker package to the offline server, you can install it. First, extract the package using the following command:\n\n    ```\n    tar xzvf /path/to/package/docker-<version>.tgz\n    ```\n\n    Then, move the Docker binaries to the correct location:\n\n    ```\n    sudo cp docker/* /usr/bin/\n    ```\n\n5. **Start Docker**: Finally, you can start Docker:\n\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl start docker\n    ```\n\nThis method should work for Docker CE (Community Edition). If you're using Docker EE (Enterprise Edition), you might need to follow a slightly different procedure. Always refer to the official Docker documentation for the most accurate information.\n\nPlease note that you should replace `<version>` with the actual version number of the Docker package that you downloaded.\n\nThis is just a general procedure and the actual steps can vary depending on your server's operating system and the Docker version. For example, the installation path might be different for some systems. Always refer to your system's and Docker's official documentation for the most accurate steps."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa27943-2685-4633-9759-99c40d21e835", "children": ["aaa297dd-a408-4162-aa2d-ec2f36a2f4ff", "aaa2f12e-ccd5-40e0-9d4c-40662d426c52"]}, "aaa297dd-a408-4162-aa2d-ec2f36a2f4ff": {"id": "aaa297dd-a408-4162-aa2d-ec2f36a2f4ff", "message": {"id": "aaa297dd-a408-4162-aa2d-ec2f36a2f4ff", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684377158.800438, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Search the latest .deb I need to install combine the information of https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ and https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/\n\nMy system is Ubuntu 20.04"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "cb66e1e7-fb74-40fd-b307-00788558ea5e", "children": ["dc674e5f-d27b-4cb6-9d0f-e8cb972fe9e6"]}, "dc674e5f-d27b-4cb6-9d0f-e8cb972fe9e6": {"id": "dc674e5f-d27b-4cb6-9d0f-e8cb972fe9e6", "message": {"id": "dc674e5f-d27b-4cb6-9d0f-e8cb972fe9e6", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684377353.419438, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "# Let's find the latest Docker .deb package for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa).\nsearch(\"download Docker .deb package for Ubuntu 20.04\")"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-browsing", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "browser"}, "parent": "aaa297dd-a408-4162-aa2d-ec2f36a2f4ff", "children": ["8ce9a2ae-fcfd-4ed2-9fca-ef6eb8cefe67"]}, "8ce9a2ae-fcfd-4ed2-9fca-ef6eb8cefe67": {"id": "8ce9a2ae-fcfd-4ed2-9fca-ef6eb8cefe67", "message": {"id": "8ce9a2ae-fcfd-4ed2-9fca-ef6eb8cefe67", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684377353.419756, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_browsing_display", "result": "# \u30100\u2020Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu | Docker Documentation\u2020docs.docker.com\u3011\nGo to https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/.

Here's an example Dockerfile that sets up a Python 3 environment and runs an Anvil Uplink server. \n\nLet's assume your server script is called `server.py` and it's located in the `./buzz` directory. \n\nHere is a Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\n# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\nFROM python:3.8-slim-buster\n\n# Set the working directory in the container to /app\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Add the current directory contents into the container at /app\nADD ./buzz /app\n\n# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Install Anvil server uplink\nRUN pip install anvil-uplink\n\n# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container\nEXPOSE 80\n\n# Run server.py when the container launches\nCMD [\"python\", \"server.py\"]\n```\n\nThis Dockerfile does the following:\n\n1. Starts from a Python 3.8 base image.\n2. Sets the working directory to `/app`.\n3. Adds the current directory (assumed to be `./buzz`) into the container at `/app`.\n4. Installs the packages listed in `requirements.txt` and the Anvil Uplink server.\n5. Exposes port 80 of the container to the outside world.\n6.

This package is often used in image processing and machine learning applications.\n\n\"Could not build wheels for pycocotools which use PEP 517 and cannot be installed directly\" means that pip is having trouble compiling and installing the package from source. \n\nPEP 517 is a Python Enhancement Proposal that provides a mechanism to use tools other than setuptools for building Python packages. When you see an error message like this, it typically means that there's a problem with the build system that the package is using, or there's a missing dependency that's required to build the package.\n\nHere are a few potential solutions:\n\n1. **Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed**: For pycocotools, you'll need Python development tools and a C compiler. On a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu), you can install these with the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-dev build-essential\n   ```\n\n   If you're using a Dockerfile, you can add this command to the Dockerfile:\n\n   ```Dockerfile\n   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel**: Sometimes, these tools may be out of date and causing issues. You can upgrade them with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a forked version of pycocotools**: Some users have reported issues with the original pycocotools package.

When you purchase a company's stock, you're buying a piece of that company, making you a shareholder. \n\n2. **Stock Markets**: The stock market is where individual and institutional investors come together to buy and sell shares in a public venue. The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq are the biggest exchanges in the world. \n\n3. **Stock Broker**: To start investing, you'll need to work with a broker or brokerage firm. There are two types of brokers: Full-Service and Discount. Full-service brokers provide a variety of services, including market research, investment advice, and retirement planning. Discount brokers offer fewer services but have cheaper fees. Nowadays, online brokerage platforms are very popular.\n\n4. **Reading Stock Quotes**: Stock Quotes usually contain the ticker symbol, the price, the volume, and other data. Here's how to read them:\n    - **Ticker Symbol**: This is the company's identification symbol in the stock market. For example, Apple's ticker symbol is AAPL, and Microsoft's is MSFT.\n    - **Price**: This is the last traded price of the stock.\n    - **Change and % Change**: These show how much the price has changed from the previous trading day.\n    - **Volume**: This shows how many shares of the stock were traded during the last trading session.\n\n5. **Types of Orders**: You need to know about different order types, like market orders, limit orders, stop orders, and stop limit orders. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages, and can be used in different scenarios based on your investment strategy.\n\n6. **Analyzing Stocks**: There are two main methods of analyzing stocks: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. \n    - **Fundamental Analysis** involves analyzing a company's financials, industry position, and market conditions to estimate its intrinsic value.\n    - **Technical Analysis** involves analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.\n\n7. **Investment Strategies**: There are many different investment strategies that can be employed, including long-term investing, short-term trading, day trading, and swing trading. Each strategy involves a different approach and a different level of risk.\n\n8. **Risk Management**: It's crucial to understand that investing in the stock market involves risk. The goal of an investor is not only to make profits but also to minimize potential losses. This is done by diversifying investments and using various risk management techniques.\n\n9. **Educational Resources**: There are many resources available to learn more about the stock market, including books, online courses, blogs, and podcasts.

The rationale is that in the long term, the stock markets will give a good rate of return despite short-term volatility. This strategy requires patience and a willingness to weather down-turns.\n\n2. **Value Investing**: Value investors look for stocks that they believe are undervalued by the market. They use fundamental analysis techniques to estimate the intrinsic value of stocks. If the current market price is below this intrinsic value, they consider the stock to be undervalued and worth buying. This strategy was made popular by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett.\n\n3. **Growth Investing**: Growth investors invest in companies that display signs of above-average growth, even if the share price appears expensive in terms of metrics such as price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios. In other words, they invest in growth stocks. \n\n4. **Momentum Investing**: This strategy involves buying stocks that have been trending upwards and selling them when they start to lose momentum. Momentum investors believe that stocks which have recently gone up are more likely to continue rising.\n\n5. **Dividend Investing**: Some investors focus on buying stocks that pay high dividends. Dividend investing can provide investors with a steady income stream in addition to potential capital appreciation. \n\n6. **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)**: This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money in the same investment periodically, regardless of the share price. The idea is that DCA will result in purchasing more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high, potentially lowering the total average cost per share of the investment.\n\n7. **Contrarian Investing**: Contrarian investors swim against the current of popular opinion. They buy when others are selling and sell when others are buying. The idea behind this strategy is that crowd behavior often leads to overpricing or underpricing of stocks, creating opportunities for profit.\n\n8. **Socially Responsible Investing (SRI)**: SRI, or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, involves choosing investments based on ethical considerations in addition to financial considerations.\n\nRemember, each investment strategy has its own risks and rewards, and what works best for you will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. It's always a good idea to research each strategy thoroughly and consider getting advice from a financial advisor before deciding which strategy to follow.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2f895-0a52-421c-be09-bfa3a25ef51c", "children": ["aaa2c160-38db-49fb-bef5-96b073007769", "aaa23809-fdf8-4082-a7e1-96dfffd7a567"]}, "aaa2c160-38db-49fb-bef5-96b073007769": {"id": "aaa2c160-38db-49fb-bef5-96b073007769", "message": {"id": "aaa2c160-38db-49fb-bef5-96b073007769", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683945133.288488, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["which strategy is the most suitable one for implementing quantitative trading?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "5cd4cf3f-6caf-4a44-8e36-71c3aa723808", "children": ["2bef19db-2fd2-4a3c-9026-c8971c6bcddb"]}, "2bef19db-2fd2-4a3c-9026-c8971c6bcddb": {"id": "2bef19db-2fd2-4a3c-9026-c8971c6bcddb", "message": {"id": "2bef19db-2fd2-4a3c-9026-c8971c6bcddb", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683945189.722487, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Quantitative trading involves developing and implementing mathematical models to predict and exploit price trends in the financial markets. This strategy can be used with various investment approaches, but there are a few that are particularly suited to it. Here are a couple of strategies commonly used in quantitative trading:\n\n1. **Mean Reversion**: This strategy is based on the concept that the price of an asset will revert to its average price over time. Quantitative traders develop statistical models to identify when an asset is significantly deviated from its mean and likely to revert back. They then buy the asset when it's below the average and sell it when it's above the average.\n\n2. **Momentum**: As discussed previously, momentum investing involves buying assets that have been trending upwards and selling them when they start to lose momentum. Quantitative traders use statistical models to identify and measure the strength of these trends and determine the optimal timing for trading.\n\n3. **Statistical Arbitrage**: In this strategy, quantitative traders take advantage of pricing inefficiencies between related assets. For instance, they might use complex algorithms to identify pairs of stocks that are historically correlated and then trade based on the divergence in their price movements.\n\n4. **Machine Learning and AI**: With the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, quantitative trading has taken a leap forward. Traders can use these technologies to predict future price movements based on large volumes of historical data.\n\n5. **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: HFT is a type of algorithmic trading characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios. HFT firms use sophisticated algorithms and powerful computers to execute trades in fractions of a second, exploiting tiny discrepancies in asset prices.\n\nEach of these strategies requires a high level of mathematical and computational expertise, as well as the ability to handle and analyze large volumes of data. Also, keep in mind that while these strategies can be profitable, they also involve significant risks, and their performance can be affected by various factors, including changes in market conditions and the performance of the underlying algorithms."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2c160-38db-49fb-bef5-96b073007769", "children": []}, "aaa23809-fdf8-4082-a7e1-96dfffd7a567": {"id": "aaa23809-fdf8-4082-a7e1-96dfffd7a567", "message": {"id": "aaa23809-fdf8-4082-a7e1-96dfffd7a567", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683945673.178664, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Should I know these strategies well if I want to design a quantitative trading system?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "5cd4cf3f-6caf-4a44-8e36-71c3aa723808", "children": ["08125d9b-3533-453a-b4bf-65facae10fcc"]}, "08125d9b-3533-453a-b4bf-65facae10fcc": {"id": "08125d9b-3533-453a-b4bf-65facae10fcc", "message": {"id": "08125d9b-3533-453a-b4bf-65facae10fcc", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683945713.933827, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Designing a quantitative trading system requires a deep understanding of financial markets, mathematical models, statistical analysis, and programming, but you may not necessarily need to be intimately familiar with all the investment strategies mentioned above. \n\nQuantitative trading is a type of investment strategy that relies on mathematical computations and number crunching to identify trading opportunities. Here's a brief overview of what you might need:\n\n1. **Mathematical Models**: Quantitative trading involves the use of mathematical models to identify trading opportunities. These models can be based on various factors, such as price patterns, economic indicators, or fundamental analysis metrics.\n\n2. **Programming Skills**: To implement your mathematical models, you'll need to be proficient in a programming language. Python is a popular choice due to its simplicity and the vast number of financial and mathematical libraries available.\n\n3. **Data Analysis**: You'll need to analyze a significant amount of data to test and optimize your trading system. This requires a solid understanding of statistics and data analysis techniques.\n\n4. **Backtesting**: This is the process of testing a trading strategy on relevant historical data to ensure its viability before implementing it in live trading.\n\n5. **Risk Management**: Implementing risk management techniques is crucial in any trading system. This can include setting stop losses, diversifying your portfolio, and only risking a small portion of your portfolio on any single trade.\n\n6. **Machine Learning**: More advanced quantitative trading systems may use machine learning algorithms to predict future price movements based on large datasets.\n\nAs far as traditional investment strategies are concerned, they can provide valuable insight into different market behaviors and can certainly be incorporated into a quantitative trading system. For example, a quantitative system might be designed to identify stocks that meet the criteria of a value investing strategy, or to apply the principles of momentum investing on a much quicker timescale.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that designing a successful quantitative trading system is a complex task that requires a significant amount of time, knowledge, and experience.

This article will discuss the advantages of traveling, including personal growth, new experiences, and improved mental health. By understanding these benefits, we may become more motivated to explore the world and embrace the wonders that travel has to offer.\n\nFirst and foremost, traveling can lead to personal growth. As we visit different places, we encounter new cultures, customs, and ways of thinking. These experiences can help broaden our horizons and encourage us to be more open-minded, flexible, and adaptable. By stepping out of our comfort zones, we can learn to face challenges head-on and become more resilient in the face of adversity.\n\nSecond, traveling can introduce us to a variety of new experiences. Whether it's trying exotic cuisine, attending a traditional festival, or learning a new language, these experiences can enrich our lives and make us more knowledgeable and well-rounded individuals. Additionally, the memories we create during our travels can last a lifetime and provide us with countless stories to share with friends and family.\n\nAnother benefit of traveling is the positive impact it can have on our mental health. Taking a break from our daily routines and responsibilities can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Furthermore, exploring new environments can stimulate our minds, keeping us mentally sharp and engaged. Traveling can also boost our self-confidence as we successfully navigate unfamiliar situations and overcome challenges.\n\nFinally, traveling can help strengthen relationships. When we travel with friends or family, we share unique experiences and create lasting memories together. These shared experiences can deepen our connections and create stronger bonds with our loved ones.\n\nIn conclusion, traveling is not only an enjoyable pastime but also a powerful tool for personal growth and well-being. By embracing the opportunities that travel provides, we can expand our horizons, create lasting memories, and enhance our mental health. So, if you have the chance to embark on a journey, don't hesitate to seize the opportunity and reap the rewards that come with exploring the world."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2bba1-b28a-48cc-9fa0-5d14b174d365", "children": ["aaa2ea05-2b48-41a3-acdc-be9e1db5dda9", "aaa29633-c06f-4b5f-8280-962ab53e2695", "aaa2e609-accc-4dcc-8ce8-70edc6823f29", "aaa2dbe1-de0b-4127-b379-c9600acb8a74", "aaa2a0ce-2871-4a44-9594-b5ed9c10e613", "aaa25431-0549-48ec-b288-c219a183272a", "aaa22662-659e-467d-aac2-5c27d9f25584", "aaa282a9-a14f-47c1-afba-6646d07e738c", "aaa2ef7e-255a-4383-b6bb-f0fcc11606a3", "aaa29013-8509-4950-bb44-05a27239bb69"]}, "aaa2ea05-2b48-41a3-acdc-be9e1db5dda9": {"id": "aaa2ea05-2b48-41a3-acdc-be9e1db5dda9", "message": {"id": "aaa2ea05-2b48-41a3-acdc-be9e1db5dda9", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683706404.692579, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If you are me but know how to use comprehensive reading to help youself make progresses.

Here's a short article about coffee that you can use for comprehensive reading practice:\n\n---\n\nCoffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. It is made by brewing roasted coffee beans, which come from the seeds of the Coffea plant. The two most commonly grown species of Coffea are Arabica and Robusta.\n\nArabica coffee beans are generally considered to be of higher quality than Robusta beans, as they have a more complex flavor and less bitterness. However, Robusta beans are often used in blends because they have a higher caffeine content and are less expensive.\n\nThere are many different ways to prepare and serve coffee. Some people prefer it black, while others like to add milk, cream, or sugar. There are also many different brewing methods, including drip coffee, espresso, French press, and pour-over.\n\nIn addition to being a popular beverage, coffee has also been shown to have some health benefits. It contains antioxidants and may help to reduce the risk of some diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease. However, it can also have negative effects if consumed in large amounts, such as increased heart rate and insomnia.\n\n---\n\nNow that you've read the article, here are some tips for implementing comprehensive reading practice:\n\n1. Read the article multiple times. This will help you to become more familiar with the vocabulary and sentence structure.\n\n2. Look up any unfamiliar words or phrases. Use a dictionary or an online translator to help you understand the meaning of any words that you don't know.\n\n3. Summarize the main ideas. After you've read the article a few times, try to summarize the main ideas in your own words. This will help you to remember what you've read and to reinforce your understanding.\n\n4. Practice reading out loud. This will help you to improve your pronunciation and your ability to speak English fluently.\n\n5. Use the article as a basis for conversation. Talk with a friend or language exchange partner about coffee and the information in the article. This will give you an opportunity to practice speaking and listening in English.\n\nBy following these tips, you can use comprehensive reading to improve your English skills and become more confident in your ability to read and understand English texts.

Arabica beans are known for their complex flavor and low bitterness, while Robusta beans have a higher caffeine content and are less expensive. \n\nThe article also describes the various ways that coffee can be brewed and served, including drip coffee, espresso, French press, and pour-over methods. Additionally, it notes that coffee can be enjoyed black or with added milk, cream, or sugar.\n\nIn terms of health benefits, coffee contains antioxidants and has been shown to reduce the risk of certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease. However, it can also have negative effects if consumed in excess, such as increased heart rate and insomnia.\n\nOverall, this article serves as a helpful overview of the many facets of coffee, from the different types of beans to the ways in which it can be prepared and consumed.

Here's some additional information that might be helpful:\n\nAntioxidants are molecules that can help to prevent or slow down damage to cells caused by unstable molecules called free radicals. Free radicals can cause oxidative stress in the body, which can contribute to the development of various diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Antioxidants help to neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, which can help to prevent or slow down the progression of these diseases.\n\nParkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. It is caused by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, which can lead to a range of symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement and coordination. The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is not fully understood, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, there are medications and therapies that can help to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life for people living with the condition.\n\nCoffee has been studied for its potential protective effects against both type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Some research has suggested that the antioxidants and other compounds in coffee may help to reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and protect against the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these potential health benefits, and to determine the optimal amount and type of coffee that may be beneficial."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|im_end|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa27bc3-6037-4019-9dc7-32b9bf830d94", "children": ["aaa22bcd-2131-4834-8630-0970920b1910", "aaa2116c-7a82-40c4-ad7c-18a7d1f910df"]}, "aaa22bcd-2131-4834-8630-0970920b1910": {"id": "aaa22bcd-2131-4834-8630-0970920b1910", "message": {"id": "aaa22bcd-2131-4834-8630-0970920b1910", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683631052.588008, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I hope you can revise me comment to a more correct and idomatic version."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "0c3a618b-ca55-4bc6-98f9-08ea055b69a0", "children": ["03db3aae-9ade-4f5a-9c80-aad6c8d0a0c8"]}, "03db3aae-9ade-4f5a-9c80-aad6c8d0a0c8": {"id": "03db3aae-9ade-4f5a-9c80-aad6c8d0a0c8", "message": {"id": "03db3aae-9ade-4f5a-9c80-aad6c8d0a0c8", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1683631053.903623, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Certainly, here's a revised version of your comment:\n\n\"I've heard that blueberries contain high amounts of antioxidants, which can help to slow down cell decay.

It can help to improve cardiovascular health, boost mood and energy levels, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.\n\nOne of the main benefits of exercise is its impact on the cardiovascular system. Exercise can help to strengthen the heart and lungs, improve circulation, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death worldwide.\n\nExercise also has a positive impact on mental health. It can help to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, and improve self-esteem and cognitive function. Regular exercise has been shown to boost energy levels, improve sleep quality, and enhance overall quality of life.\n\nIn addition to these physical and mental health benefits, exercise can also be a fun and social activity. Whether it's joining a sports team, taking a fitness class, or going for a walk with a friend, exercise can provide opportunities to connect with others and enjoy the benefits of a healthy lifestyle together.\n\n---\n\nTake your time to read through the article a few times, look up any unfamiliar words or phrases, and summarize the main ideas in your own words.

The doors are represented by a sequence of 255 values along a known length wall.\n\nHere's a simple algorithm to achieve this task:\n\n1. First, preprocess the image to enhance the contrast and reduce noise, if necessary. You can use OpenCV's `equalizeHist` and `medianBlur` functions.\n\n2. Detect edges in the image using the Canny edge detection algorithm provided by OpenCV's `Canny` function. You can fine-tune the parameters to improve the results.\n\n3. Since the wall length is known, you can look for lines representing walls using the HoughLines algorithm. This can be done using OpenCV's `HoughLines` function. Filter out the lines that are close to the known wall length.\n\n4. Next, identify potential door regions by scanning horizontally along the detected lines. If you find a sequence of 255 values (door width) between two segments of 0 values (walls), mark that region as a potential door.\n\n5. To further filter the potential doors, you can use the aspect ratio of a typical door (e.g., height/width = ~2.1). For each potential door region, calculate the aspect ratio, and if it's close to the expected door aspect ratio, consider it as a valid door.\n\nHere's some sample code to help you get started:\n\n```cpp\n#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>\n\nusing namespace cv;\nusing namespace std;\n\nvector<Rect> findDoors(Mat& grayImage, float wallLength, float doorWidth, float doorAspectRatio)\n{\n    // Preprocess image\n    equalizeHist(grayImage, grayImage);\n    medianBlur(grayImage, grayImage, 3);\n\n    // Edge detection\n    Mat edges;\n    Canny(grayImage, edges, 50, 150, 3);\n\n    // Detect lines\n    vector<Vec2f> lines;\n    HoughLines(edges, lines, 1, CV_PI / 180, 100);\n\n    // Find potential door regions\n    vector<Rect> potentialDoors;\n    // ... (Iterate through lines, scan horizontally, and identify potential doors)\n\n    // Filter potential doors based on aspect ratio\n    vector<Rect> doors;\n    for (const Rect& door : potentialDoors)\n    {\n        float aspectRatio = static_cast<float>(door.height) / door.width;\n        if (abs(aspectRatio - doorAspectRatio) < 0.1)\n        {\n            doors.push_back(door);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return doors;\n}\n```\n\nThis code snippet provides a starting point for your door detection algorithm.

Here's a short article about traveling and experiencing new cultures. As you read, try to learn new words and phrases in context:\n\n---\n\nTitle: The Joy of Traveling and Embracing New Cultures\n\nTraveling to new destinations is an enriching experience that broadens our horizons and allows us to immerse ourselves in diverse cultures. When we venture beyond our familiar surroundings, we are presented with countless opportunities to grow both personally and intellectually.\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of traveling is the chance to sample local cuisine. From the vibrant spices of India to the delicate flavors of Japanese sushi, each destination offers a unique culinary adventure that tantalizes our taste buds. Food is a universal language that connects people and provides insight into a region's history, traditions, and values.\n\nAs we traverse foreign lands, we also have the opportunity to engage with locals, fostering meaningful connections that enhance our understanding of different ways of life. By actively participating in cultural exchanges, we develop empathy and tolerance, essential qualities for becoming global citizens.\n\nLanguage barriers can sometimes pose challenges, but overcoming these obstacles can be a fulfilling accomplishment. Learning a few phrases or expressions in the local language not only helps us navigate unfamiliar terrain but also demonstrates respect and appreciation for the host culture.\n\nFinally, exploring the natural beauty and architectural marvels of different destinations instills a sense of wonder and appreciation for the world around us. From the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand to the awe-inspiring ruins of ancient civilizations, each journey leaves us with lasting memories and a yearning to continue discovering the marvels of our planet.\n\nIn conclusion, traveling is an invaluable experience that enriches our lives by exposing us to new cultures, foods, and perspectives. By embracing these opportunities for growth and learning, we become more open-minded, compassionate, and well-rounded individuals.\n\n---\n\nAs you read through the article, consider using a dictionary or online resource to look up any unfamiliar words or phrases. Additionally, try to practice using these new vocabulary words in conversation or writing to help reinforce your understanding and improve your English skills."]}, "status": "finished_successfully",

Here's how you might answer the question about soft skills and teamwork, using examples from your past experiences:\n\n\"One of the key soft skills I possess is effective communication, which I believe is critical in a teamwork environment. In my current role at Roborock, I often have to communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical team members. For example, when I improved the mAP of our vision function by about 10%, I needed to explain the process and results to the product team, and I did so using simple language and visual aids. This enabled us to collaboratively decide on the next steps and ensure everyone was on the same page.\n\nAnother important soft skill I have honed is problem-solving. In my role at ChuangLe Technology, I was tasked with designing a construction site video processing system. I encountered a challenge when trying to balance operational efficiency with development cycle. I resolved this by using pybind11 to bypass the GIL lock for Python multi-threading and using Docker Compose for deployment. This innovative solution not only solved the problem but also increased overall system efficiency.\n\nIn terms of teamwork, I have always believed in the power of collaboration. During my project at WallpaperSearcher, I had to work with a diverse team of engineers and designers. We used agile methodologies to ensure smooth collaboration and used tools like GitHub for version control and code reviews. Despite our different backgrounds and skill sets, we were able to work together effectively to improve the search algorithm of a popular wallpaper website.\n\nThese experiences have taught me the importance of soft skills and teamwork in achieving project objectives and fostering a positive work environment. I am confident that these skills will enable me to contribute effectively to the team at EF Technology.\""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop": "<|diff_marker|>"}, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2ca00-9771-4880-ba78-66c587ea56ff", "children": ["aaa233c9-282f-4357-9d31-615e3433f51e"]}, "aaa233c9-282f-4357-9d31-615e3433f51e": {"id": "aaa233c9-282f-4357-9d31-615e3433f51e", "message": {"id": "aaa233c9-282f-4357-9d31-615e3433f51e", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684136074.91545, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Now, I will provide my reply in my own words, correct my reply, make it more native-sounding and point out what content I can enrich."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "4b4a9c05-cd93-428b-a2be-40010f152b58", "children": ["48fcaf7d-e19b-42c8-b0f2-700ab6f7395a"]}, "48fcaf7d-e19b-42c8-b0f2-700ab6f7395a": {"id": "48fcaf7d-e19b-42c8-b0f2-700ab6f7395a", "message": {"id": "48fcaf7d-e19b-42c8-b0f2-700ab6f7395a", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1684136081.677963, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure, please go ahead and provide your reply.
